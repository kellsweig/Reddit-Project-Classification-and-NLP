I don't really know where to begin with this, as far as where I should go or what I should bring. I have a decent amount of gear. But, I think, most of it is more applicable to 3-5 day trips. Less long term stuff. I would really love to go to Alaska, because it has the largest national forests, but it is pretty far from where I am, so I think I'd like to stay in the lower 48. \n",

I love function over form mostly, I'm a tech guy not looking for glamping persay but do intend some devices and a solar panel that can fit in a new backpack, looking for a multi day setup. About 3 days at a time to start. Any suggestions useful, such as places , kit, etc, to start I'm looking at a backpack and a tent and a couple starters , I also have my 4 door sedan for transport. I'm looking at the gregory bags with hydration like the zulo or paragon etc . Would love some boots on the ground ideas. Thanks!\n",

It's not like normal camping trips where we hike or something: We do swimming, golfing, ping pong, and all sorts of awesome stuff. It's consistently one of the best weekends of the year.

The game went pretty slow, considering our troop is rather small, but it was really fun. About an hour in (it was close to pitch black at this point) while I was playing defense, I saw the entire other team and some of ours running to us. While I was thinking *\"I'm gonna have to play some really good defense,\"* they started yelling at me and another guy who was playing defense to come over.

There was suddenly a group of teenagers a few yards away from us, yelling and cussing. Then I see some sort of bright red thing being shot at us from them. I didn't think *\"The hell? Is this related to the guy on the run from the cops?\"* I didn't think *\"What's even happening right now?\"* I just thought ***\"HOLY FUCK THERE ARE FIRECRACKERS BEING SHOT AT US, RUN!\"*** They probably would only have given us minor injuries had they hit us, but it was the scariest, most adrenaline filled moment of my life so I just booked it.
