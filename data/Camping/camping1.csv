4,1697497787.0,Camping groups,"Are there camping groups out there, that someone can recommend, that doesn't cost and arm and a leg, has a reputation for being safe, and welcomes newbies? I will fly anywhere so location is not a problem. Prefer to do in late summer/early fall when its not super cold, but bugs are dying off. Probably will have to wait until next year but would like to start researching now. 

There is a fairly new group a few hours from me in ATL, but they only do it for a day or two and its always on the days I work.  I will still keep trying to join them one day. I have been waiting forever to go on my first camping trip, met a girl group here on reddit and on tiktok that I joined to go on a group trip with, but both ended up canceling the event for various reasons. I have been buying equipment for awhile now. 

Thought I would find a guy that would take me camping but no such luck, last ex despised the outdoors was a musician and stayed in clubs,  no wonder that didnt workout. So, I dont want to simply wait until my next relationship to try to go again. 

Everytime I think a trip is going to happen it gets canceled for some reason that has nothing to do with me. And no, I do not want to just go by myself, especially not the first time or just do it in my backyard. I want a real camping experience with people that have the knowledge and expertise.  

Thank you in advance for any tips and suggestions!",camping

We visited the islands cause no one was on them and they even have a dock and everything.

Our campsite was all the way to the right so we were completely alone. As we were setting up our tarp we started hearing rain drops, we looked over the lake and a huge wall of rain was headed towards us, it was fucking awesome.

Although it was hot and humid, there werent any bugs oddly enough. We had a great time and id love to be able to rent the two spots on the island!",camping

[Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov) updated information on our reservation to reflect a 10am check-in and a 9:30am check out.

Of course I'd have a CO and even a propane gas detector, and keep a window cracked. So I guess what it comes down to is, just how prone to failure are those 20 lb canisters?

But what about plastics, paper/plastic hybrids, etc? Is burning those a grievous sin as well? I understand chemical by-products released from burning things such as plastic outside of the proper facilities, but is my one weekend of camping really affecting things?

Edit: I appreciate the replies, even the ones that come off as condescending. To clarify a couple of things:

I was raised in the woods far removed from civilization. I have a healthy respect for nature and preserving it. The fact that I’m asking the question and wanting to improve my understanding/practices should somewhat reflect that. 

The camping I’m referring to is at a public campground in the center of my city. It has a dedicated fire pit. It’s not backcountry or very remote. I can drive my car 3 minutes and be in the nearest neighborhood. I’m not trying to diminish the importance of LNT, but the footprint of humanity is here regardless of my participation in good/bad practices. 

I agree with anyone who says the mentality of “what I do doesn’t matter,” is a bad state of mind. However, I am a realist at heart and believe that until we fix the pollution caused by large corporations, whether or not we individually dedicate our lives to green living doesn’t matter and the 1% are going to cause more environmental damage than we ever could.",camping

Also, we have zero camping neighbors the whole weekend if Reservations.gov is right. Is that because highs are still in the mid 90s? Maybe. But I’d take mediocre weather and some peace and quiet over perfect weather and tons of camping neighbors (other than you fine folks, of course 😉😅).

Hi! My boyfriend has been talking about going camping probably since I met him 5 years ago. We have just never had the finances or time to get the gear to do it — and honestly I haven’t really wanted to do it all that much so I haven’t tried to make it happen. I want to do something special for him but I’m a little high maintenance and an overly cautious planner so I want to make sure we get it right so it can be an enjoyable experience for us both so it’s something we can do again.

88,1697223577.0,New California campsite reservation law,"Finally, a good step in the right direction for the California campground reservation system.

""You could be banned from California campgrounds for bailing on your campsite reservation"" 

""A new bill signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsome aims to deter no-shows, including banning repeat offenders.

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan introduced Assembly Bill 618. It makes several changes to how California State Parks (CSP) will handle camping reservations.

The law states that campers must cancel their booking seven days before arrival. Those who don’t will lose their reservation fee, the cost of the first night’s stay and will incur an $8 cancellation fee. If campers don’t show up by the day after their reservation date, the CSP will cancel the remaining days on their reservation. If a camper is a no-show three or more times in a calendar year, CSP can ban them from making new reservations.

To make it easier for campers to make reservations, the law makes campsites more available by limiting the number of days people can stay at the same campsite in a year to 30 and limits the length of reservations during peak season to seven consecutive nights. The bill will also implement a lottery system by 2025 for five of the most popular park campsites, to be determined by the CSP based on advanced booking interest.

The new laws take effect January 1, 2024""

While I try to beans remote as possible, there are times I have to pay for a site in a state park or similar.  For work reasons, on the east coast I’ve had to spend 11 days at a state park and so I picked the cheapest campground, no utilities and furthest from the rest.  All week it has been peaceful and other campers have been quiet and respectful.  

Enter today.   A family rolls up in two vehicles, and bursts from them yelling, screaming, running, etc.  Not just the kids  but the parents  who are trying to yell over their kids acting like their buddies instead of their parents.    They echo through the whole river valley.  After they get set up, the mother and father break out guitars and start playing and singing LOUDLY as if they are auditioning for American Idol.  This went on for hours.  You could tell they were pissing off everyone else and one camper from the end of the campground yelled SHUT UP.  
I was in the campsite next to these people.  

Point is, take notice of the vibe when you arrive.  Are people partying or is it quiet?   What are other campers doing?   Are they playing music or are they enjoying the serenity of nature?

A hammock is not really viable since trees are rare on festival camping grounds, and to sleep in the car you often have to pay for a separate caravan/mobile home/campervan ticket and camping ground. A regular tent with a cot in it would get me off the ground but the tent would still get dirty.

121,1697090043.0,Have you had any scary or life-threatening experiences while camping?,"Back in 2021 my husband and I were camping in Wyoming at the Boysen Reservoir. We got really lucky and were able to book a “beach” front site, directly leading to the water but the downside was that it was very, very far away from the other campsites. We were essentially isolated from everyone else, at the time though it sounded like a dream come true. 

The thing about Wyoming is that it’s so desolate to the point where it’s pitch black and eerily dead silent once the sun is gone. We set up our camp, enjoyed our fire, but shortly after that, a random SUV with blacked out windows came driving down our road and into our site. 

They drove towards us, my husband tried to wave to them in case they were lost and needed help, but instead they ignored us and drove down to the beach, stayed there for 5 minutes, turned around and went back up the way they came. 

We immediately got a bad vibe, my husband told me to throw everything in the car and he kept shining a flashlight towards the beach because we had a feeling they dropped someone off to watch us. After we packed up we got in the car and hauled ass. Lo and behold, the same car drove back into our campsite and when they saw us leaving, they actually started chasing us. Mind you, the roads in Wyoming are bumpy and unkept when you’re in the wilderness- on top of that, enormous wildlife that wanders in and out of the streets. My husband said “I have to go fast, are you ok with that?” And I said “just go and get us out of here.” 

We were easily going 80mph down these windy roads and even through a canyon, they were on our tail for about 10 mins until we lost them after passing through the canyon. Most terrifying experience of our lives, we think about it to this day and wonder what could’ve happened if we didn’t listen to our gut at that moment.

Edit: wow! I had no idea this would blow up. To those who shared their stories and experiences like this post was intended for, thank you. 
To those who made it a debate about guns, you do you- but I want to live, and not be ignorant to the fact that dangerous people do, in fact, exist. 

And to those who claimed I’m either lying or paranoid- for one, we tried to engage with them, but these folk barreled past us without a word. First red flag. Two, our site was so isolated, why would anyone pull up to our campsite just to sit at the beach for a few minutes and then leave? You can’t drive across the sand to the other campsites because of the water, so if you’re coming to our site, you’re doing it for a reason. Second red flag. We were chased by them for miles after we started leaving, so it’s pretty self explanatory at that point. Boom, suspicions confirmed. 🙄  thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",camping

That's about it. There was no amplified music. I didn't hear any generators. There were no drunken arguments. Honestly, the most exciting thing was a couple deer that passed by.

I don't know if y'all were hoping for some horror story or something; I know Reddit loves drama. Sometimes all that drama is exhausting. Sometimes, you just want to camp in a national park, and see a bunch of stars at night. We saw a ton of stars. The only real negative thing was the price of firewood.

Big Meadows is great. It has a ton of facilities. The meadows are in fact, big. It's near a bunch of cool trails. I get that Shenandoah ain't no Yosemite or even Acadia, but for a lot of people, it's fairly close to where they live.

Some caveats:

* Big Meadows campground is huge. There could have a bunch of loud drunken people blasting music in some other section, who knows.
* It did get down to the mid 30s. Maybe the kind of people who get really wild are the type who can't handle the cold.
* Big Meadows is basically fully booked all the time. You're not gonna walk-in with your stuff

We want to car camp since not all of us have gear for backpacking. It can be a dirt road but not too far or bumpy. Something that will have decent spaces available about a month in advance. We also want to do a campfire, so we don't want anywhere with fire restrictions. We all have sleeping bags down to at least 35F so I believe temp shouldn't be a problem on the coast.

191,1696878716.0,Lost it on some neighboring campers (rant),"Went camping with the family this weekend (wife, 9 yr old daughter, and 7 yr old son).  Loved everything about the campsite and area, except for the inconsiderate neighbors we had.  Like most campsites, ours had a quite time policy from 10PM - 7AM.  The campsite next to ours had people from at least 3 other campsites gathered there.  Probably at least 10-12 people.  They never really made any effort to be quiet so we weren't surprised when 10:00 rolled around and they kept going as normal.  No music but just talking and laughing very loudly.  Even with earplugs in, they were still going strong at midnight and keeping us up when I finally decided to go say something in not the most polite of ways.  They did quiet down somewhat after that, but at that point I was so pissed I ended up getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep.  My wife and kids didn't fare much better either.  

The next day, between being already being sick and now deliriously exhausted I wasn't in the most tolerant of moods to say the least, nor feeling very kindly towards our inconsiderate neighbors.  As we're eating lunch, we watch them set up some stands that were about 5ft tall about 30 ft apart from each other on the gravel spot for where you would set tents up, put empty glass beer bottles on the stands then proceed to try to knock them off with a frisbee.  As anyone with a few functioning braincells could see happening, it didn't take long for one of the bottles to shatter after falling on the gravel.  Having cut my foot to the bone before on broken glass in a lake and not being able to walk right for months after, I'm a little touchy about people being careless with glass, so I went over said, ""Are y'all fucking retarded?  What are you thinking?  Did you not see that happening?""  (sorry for the ""R"" word).  Not the smartest approach, but I was exhausted, feeling horrible, not thinking straight and really just seeing red at that point like I haven't in many years.  One guy looked like he wanted to fight me, and the others weren't obviously happy about it either.  I typically keep a pretty level head in just about every situation but that was just the perfect storm to really send me over the edge.

I did go back and apologize for that, as I did feel bad for reacting like that but man, I'm just so sick of people being completely inconsiderate of others and careless about things.  The older I get the less patience I have for it.  Anyone who's ever shattered glass should also know there's no way you're ever going to get every last little piece of shattered glass out of gravel.  Even on a hardwood floor you need a vacuum cleaner to make sure you get up all the small pieces.  Sooner or later it's going to get turned up, go through someone's tent and into them.",camping

229,1696782317.0,Car camping - Planning a bare bones trip,"A friend of mine and I are planning a cold, late October/early November car camping trip.

Here is the problem, I don't have a tent and money is tight. The budget for the trip all in has to be $500CDN between the two of us. The tent has to fit two large men and keep out the worst of the chill. We both have great sleeping bags and sleeping mats. 

I'm going to be spending $40 on wood. I know a place where I can fill my trunk for that amount, good for the 2 nights we plan to spend. I want to keep food and drinks around $75. The less we spend on food the more we can spend on fun. It'll be at least $30 for gas. I'm going to need propane for the stove so that's another $25. Other than that, all of my gear is in good condition. I have extra blankets, clothes and the like to keep warm.

All said, I'm looking at $170CDN in non-negotiable purchases. That leaves $330 for a tent. 

Blessedly, the campsite is a free provincial site up a gravel road. No expenses there.

As far as food is concerned, we're good with eating rice and canned goods for the trip. 

Any help with the budget or recommendations for a decent tent will be much appreciated! 

As far as entertainment, we plan to fish, read, play board games, and listen to music.

264,1696606716.0,Better Hot Water solution for group camping!,"I'll start off by saying I'm an engineer and love solving problems with technical solution, even if there really isn't a ""problem"" to begin with - but if you'll indulge me, I think many folks here will enjoy the discussion and ideas.

Most of my camping is now focused on groups of 20+ people due to my son being in Cub Scouts. It's entirely car-camping based but we often do 2-night campouts. 

The ""problem"" is that kids LOVE hot cocoa, and adults like myself sure enjoy coffee and being able to wash utensils with warm water.

As seen in the attached picture, we have taken to using the orange Igloo drink cooler as a hot water on-tap source. People can make their own tea, coffee, or hot cocoa as desired without having to heat an individual serving.

We heat the water with a propane burner and stock pot, which means we have to pick up a boiling pot and dump it into the cooler periodically. It works, but it's less convenient and I feel like only a matter of time before someone has an accident and douses their feet or legs with 2 gallons of scalding water.

But we're now all accustomed to hot water on demand, so I'm wondering if other people have suggestions, even if I have to make them myself?

Ideally, this solution would be :

1) Propane fired
2) Big enough to hold at least 2 gallons of water hot enough to brew coffee .
3) Insulated so as not to constantly burning fuel.
4) Not require electricity, or running water/water pressure.
5) Not involve manual transfer of boiling water from heater to insulated container 

The best thought I can come up with is using a similar beverage cooler with a coil of copper tubing in an external 'chimney' over a propane burner, that would result in convection circulation. 
But I'm curious if anyone else has ideas. Thanks!",camping

268,1696582243.0,I just returned from my first solo trip and it was magical!,"6 years ago when I moved to Oz I had never been camping and when my husband brought it up my reaction was,  ""We're going to sleep outside? Why?"" But his family are big campers and it didn't take long to get me to go along. 
 
I have been really run down lately. Work stress, plus I gave up all my leave last year to do end of life care for my husbands grandfather overseas so I haven't had a proper break from work in 2 years.  I had a little leave saved up and I really wanted to so something by myself which my husband fully supported. 

We are lucky to live in the most beautiful place in the entire world, so I don't need to travel far to experience natural beauty.  I chose a camp ground 90 minutes from home because I was familiar with it, and it has full mobile reception which I felt was important on my first trip alone. 

My tent is absolutely enormous because we invested in the oztrail 10 person during the Christmas sales and I don't have a smaller one. It was actually relatively easy to set up on my own! I wanted a bit a glamping feel so I brought along my bedding and a few pretty bits from home.  

The best parts of this site for me are the rock slides, (like a naturally formed waterslide) which I spent an entire morning gleefully riding, and also the rock wallabies. There is a rare species of wallaby that only lives in this small region, and this particular colony is friendly to humans and you can hand feed them. The mothers with joeys are usually more reserved but I went out at dusk and had an incredible interaction with a mama who let me stroke her baby in her pouch while she ate out of my hand!

286,1696478875.0,How do you FIREPIT?,"My friends and I, we camp all year including in the rain and snow. In bad weather we sit under a tarp.

But there is a problem with sheltering under a tarp and placing the fire OUTSIDE the tarp (which you must do if you like your tarp). The problem is that a circular fire will only warm the 2-3 people who are sitting at the edge of the tarp close to the fire.So, we built a hearth about 5-6 feet wide, alongside the edge of the tarp. We stacked the rocks high at the back and left the front open. The ends of the wall curve inward but then open up to allow more heat to reflect at the ends. It works amazingly. Of course it does require a fair bit of wood because the fire is pretty wide. (See pic)

Another thing we tried recently was to build a platform of stones (about 1 foot high) and then we put our fire on top of the platform. It wasn't a very cold night and it was dry, so we didn't need to think about insulating the heat, etc. This made the fire a little more interactive; the edges of the platform were like a countertop where we could place our foil-wrapped snacks, etc. Also, one corner of the platform was a pretty acute angle, like a spur of stone that you could stand over, with feet on either side, to get REALLY warm.

What have you done to maximize the effectiveness of your hearth build?

We were in Hoosier National Forest, and had an alarm set for 4:30 to start looking for a good site by 5 to give us enough plenty of time to set up camp. We had to settle for a spot that was probably too close to the trail and had to move a bunch of downed wood. On our way out the next day (loop trail) we kept an eye out for future sites, but only saw one ‘maybe’ area. 

The problem is there was a lot of understory of young trees and brambles, and the flexibility of not needing a flat clear spot for a tent (hammock camping) didn’t help much.

365,1696258381.0,Taking the family for our first camping trip next week. Give me your tips for camping with little kids.,"I grew up camping all the time, and continued to do so into adulthood. Over the last few years that I've gotten married and had kids, my camping time has been limited to 1-2 trips a year. But next week, my wife has agreed to take our whole family for a 2 night trip. So it will be me, my wife (who has never tent camped before), and our 3 kids (5 years, 2 years, 8 months). 

It's going to be pretty primitive, but there will be porta pottys at the campground but no power/running water. I'm just really concerned about my kids being bored. Like I said, I was definitely camping at younger ages than 5, but we also were going on trips with extended family so I had cousins to play with and such when we camped. My kids don't have that yet. What tips do you guys have so that no one is miserable, and everyone will want to go again? What are the must have items or must do activities when it comes specifically to camping with little kids?

Thanks!",camping

374,1696234119.0,Camping terminology,"I see the terms “primitive camping” and “dispersed camping” used somewhat often in this sub and am trying wrap my head around what they might mean.

 I am guessing that they are used in the US? 

Can someone define them through descriptions? 

For context, I am Canadian, and these are some terms I use.. (disclaimer there are probably others we use in Canada that I have missed). 

1. Backpacking: Hiking camping while on a trail. Campsites may be designated or not (just a good spot). The land is either a park (Provincial or Federal), or public (Crown).  There is never a picnic table. There might be a tent pad, outhouse, bear box. 

2. Canoe,kayak or bike packing - similar to 1 but on water or by bike. 

3. Car camping: Driving to a designated campground that has designated individual sites. People camp in tents, or may take trailers, RVs or truck & camper combos. 
a) The majority are public: either in parks (provincial or Federal) or around logging leases. Amenities are basic: maybe a few drinking water taps throughout the campground, outhouse toilets, no power or water hook ups. The individual site has a picnic table and fire ring; sometimes a bear box. 
b) There are privately owned ones that have fancier amenities like water and power at each site, buildings with flush toilets and showers.  Sometimes there is a pool and clubhouse. The individual site has at minimum a picnic table and fire ring (to start). 
 
4. Boondocking: Driving out into the bush on a logging or resource road and finding a spot to pull over and camp at. The land is public (crown, or under a logging lease).  Boondockers where I live often seem more likely to have vans or a truck & camper set up than use tents.",camping

449,1695942949.0,Finally Had First Unsafe Outdoors Experience,"Hey campers!

So...it finally happened. Bummer. 

I (usually a tent camper) rented an a-frame for a small, female-only family trip. Two female adults, two female kid/teens. 

I woke up at 3 am to hear what I think was footsteps outside our a-frame. Gahhhhh. I couldn't see out, but the possible intruder could see in because three sides of the a-frame were made of corrugated plastic. 

I was really scared, especially because I had my two beloved nieces and sister in there with me. 

I stayed inside and kept covered up, in hopes that the intruder would not be able to tell the gender or age of the people inside. 

I didn't pick up my cell to call for help,because I didn't want my face to be illuminated or my female voice to be heard. I also didn't have a way to give emergency responders directions to the a-frame since it was accessed via a path in the woods. 

I stayed awake and tried to breathe calmly, reminding myself that the sun would eventually be up and that MOST people do not get killed or attacked when camping. I also reminded myself that the person had not yet seen fit to attempt entering the structure. 

I'm not SURE it was a person out there. It was raining very hard, which sort of obscured the sound, but it really did sound like a human in hiking boots taking a few steps, pausing a while, and continuing to explore the site. This continued for 3.5 hours. 

We had no items of value, so nothing was taken. 

The a-frame was in the back of the owner's farm, so it wasn't another camper at a neighboring site. 

I mentioned this to the owner, and she didn't explain it away as an animal or anything, like ""Oh there are tons of deer. They walk around at night."" She did say she would look around for footprints and that the day after we left, they found a dead/attacked duck on the property. 

I felt so oddly defenseless in there. Any other campers experience this? I would love any safety tips or insight. I

I'll definitely force myself to stay outside again SOON, but I'm definitely open to any tips on how I could have been better prepared to handle this, especially as a female camper.

453,1695918730.0,Camping & Exploring the California Coast,"Have been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina and finally made it to Southern California.

Henry Miller said that if we are always arriving and departing, it is also true that we are eternally anchored, that one's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things. I return to his writing often in life, but thought about him constantly while cycling the Pacific Coast again. His library in Big Sur was the destination for my first cross-country bike tour ten years ago, but again a precious checkpoint here and now after traveling thousands of miles from the Arctic Ocean to this journey’s dewy, doughy center.

The hardest days collected en route seem to linger with paralytic hypnosis. I lay awake in the tent at night waiting for sleep while reliving these visions of endless gravel lanes through abandoned territories, ice roads crossed over empty tundra, overgrown trail lines connecting nowhere with nothingness. In hindsight those days feel less like a haunting and more of a moveable feast, holy tokens petrified in wayfaring memoriam, voracious days and weeks wrought with depletion, each static horizon barbed by glacial blades and bergs. Cycling in California is much, much easier.

483,1695813577.0,[UK Camping Q] - Government Law or Campsite Law?,"Just to preface this question, its not a caravan/ car camping question per say...  


TL:DR Why are people sleeping in cars 'banned' at campsites?

Hi all,

A group of us are off camping in the Peak District next week, 3 of us are regular campers, but our driver, whilst a competent outdoors person, does not have a tent and would like to sleep in the back of their car (not a van/ caravan etc).

The campsite we are staying at says we can leave the car next to where our tents are pitched, but its strictly prohibited to sleep in the car, even though everyone is paying the full price, per person, per tent, per car etc.

I've never been in a position of needing to know the answer to this, as although I usually have my car, I've always camped in a tent...

However, the campsite owner doesn't seem to have a valid reason as to why this is not allowed AND when I have looked at alterative campsites in the area, they all suggest that its not allowed BUT won't give a satisfactory reason as to why not :/

Is there a reason?

I can only surmise that 'maybe' it has something to do with keeping the engine on? My friend has an EV, but I guess its a blanket ban no exceptions, IF indeed that is the reason? But why not just be transparent about why not?

498,1695759838.0,"Didn't open new Core tent right away, it's broken, what to do with it now?"," I  am heartbroken. Saved since May for a dream Core 9 Person Instant tent.  Ordered it in August from Amazon (my first mistake in this story I  guess), hoping to be ready for when the Fall weather hit.

Stupid me - I did not set up the tent at home. I am very familiar with these Core tents and didn't anticipate any issues.

Well,  I took it on a state park trip 2 weekends ago and right out of the bag  it was broken. Three of the upper poles that connect to the side hubs  are split from end to end and one of the poles was backward (the  pushbutton side facing inward). It wouldn't stand, because the way one  of the poles was ""wonky"" in the side hub. It took the help of many  fellow campers as well as a DNR employee to get the tent to  stand...precariously. At one point we had it rigged with twine to tree  branches up above lol. It was either that or just pack up and go home,  wasting vacation days.

As soon as I  got home I emailed Core about the issue. Adding to my heartbreak, as I  worried would happen, I am out of luck. They told me sorry and to return  to Amazon, but it is past the 30 day return window for that. I'm beyond  frustrated (mostly with myself!).

What  can I do with this tent? I do not want it, will never use it again as I  can't trust it to take camping. I am an older solo camper (with dog)  that can't chance getting somewhere and not being able to set up. Lesson  learned, go with a single-hub tent to lessen chance of issues/easier to  prop up and solve if a hub doesn't work (and lesson learned, set up a  tent the second you get it). I had really wanted this larger tent for  myself so that on rainy days I could have a lot of room to hang out -  but I'm glad at least I wasn't several states from home. Now I know to  stick to a tent I can manage myself should something happen. I know you  can order poles and hubs, but at this point I am not interested in  fixing it (like I said, will never trust a multi-hub now) and I don't  have time to be trying to mess with taking something like this apart.

Anyway  - I don't do Facebook, ebay or any of that sort of stuff to try and  sell it and don't know anyone who would want it, as it's technically  broken. Shipping it would probably cost a small fortune even if I wanted  to give it away online. What would be the best way for me to maybe  donate it somewhere (with the caveat that it's broken and someone handy  would have to fix it first)? I hate to just put it out in my trash,  because I'm sure someone mechanically inclined could fix it up. It's a  beautiful tent (if it worked). Advice?

I don't like mummy bags, and I'm not interested in quilts. I've tried both, and neither is for me.

I'm after a bag intended for comfort in 30-40° overnight temps, so I'm guessing a 0° or -10°F survival rating?

I sleep cold and I doubt I'll be camping much once the overnight temps are in the low-30s, but upper-20s is also possible. Yes, I layer up and I'm not in any danger in that regard. I have a decent down bag from REI (house-brand), but it's made for tall people, not wide people, and there's just too much space beneath my feet, but due to my shoulder width and waist size, side sleeping is an issue.

What I've done so far... I loaded each with pillows and weights so each bag is roughly 28lbs. I simulated weight for my gear.

I bought a jackery 550 with solar panel from Costco and thinking about running an electric blanket. I’m looking at a sealy queen size blanket but it’s AC connected only. I’ve seen people say to get a blanket that’s 12v to save the battery life. If I were to get a converter like the one in the pic. Will I save the battery or just plug in directly to the AC plug. I’m just trying to at least get 6 hours of use while I sleep. I’m new to this. Thanks,camping

577,1695482559.0,Pop-up tent for early October camping in the UK?," 

Hi all, I'm really excited about planning my first solo camping trip for early October and had a few questions. I'm really excited to get out there and experience nature firsthand. I only have a 3-4 person pop-up tent - would that be suitable for the conditions then, or is there too much risk of rain/wind?

As a first-time solo camper accessing sites by public transport/a short taxi, I don't mind having to change trains a couple of times, but going from bus to train to bus to train isn't really what I'm looking for. What spots would you recommend that are doable without a car? It would also be nice if there was a pub or small restaurant nearby in case the weather gets too bad - I know, I know, having a backup warm meal option is ""half ass camping"" for you veterans out there, but hey, it's my first time so cut me some slack! I'd love to find a more remote wooded area if possible for the full camping experience, including hopefully getting to warm up around a little fire in the evenings and enjoying the beauty of it getting dark early, settling into my tent with a good book while listening to the sounds of the woods. Nothing like warming up over a little fire, ey?

Additionally, as an inexperienced camper, are there any small, low-cost items I should bring that could make a big difference in comfort? I'm planning on really bundling up in my sleeping bag, but open to any other tips.

With budget and size being a consideration when using public transit, any advice on items that should be prioritised or deprioritised in my packing based on typical October weather?

Lastly, how likely is it I'd run into other campers that late/early in the season? I don't mind being somewhat secluded, but it would be nice to have others nearby just in case. I'm also curious about the rules around extending stays if enjoying my first trip. Like hypothetically, since i know farmers don't really care if you wild camp on their land, would the manager/staff approach me to leave if I overstayed my pitch by a day or two?

Any advice from any level of camping expierience is greatly appreciated! I'm determined to get out there via public transport, but I want to plan carefully since I'm new to camping solo. Let me know your thoughts!

578,1695480793.0,Anyone else have an experience like this?,"So the wife and I were camping at a State park campground on the lake.  Just the two of us and our pup.  We took the canoe out for a cruise and while out a storm was rolling in.  As we rowed back up to the site our neighbor was in our site moving our stuff around.  He looked up saw us and asked if we had our pup.  I told him yes while looking at him like why are you around my stuff.  He said he noticed the storm coming and didn't want our stuff to get wet and proceeded back to his site....  Nothing was missing and he seemed to genuinely just putting our stuff away.  We even had a few conversations with the guy and his family afterwards.  It just took me back because I would never have thought to move someone's things out of the rain.  I was always in the mind set you leave your stuff out then you know what could happen to it.  Any thoughts???


Edit to original post. I have been camping since I was a kid for 30+ years and this was the first time I have had this happen. I was definitely appreciative afterwards but was surprised someone was on our site initially.

After checking out their website and liking what I saw, I decided to reach out to the store owner and haggle for a better deal. He ended up giving me a substantial discount but asked me to pick it up from their warehouse, conveniently located nearby. Once I got back home, I wasted no time setting up the RTT. I then took my son on a two-day adventure to West Virginia to give it a test run. I must say, it exceeded my expectations overall.

Next up, I'm planning a solo camping trip for approximately a month. During this extended camping adventure, I realized that I might need to conduct some additional tests and preparations. I'm eager to learn what steps to take to ensure the RTT's reliability and my safety in this situation. I'm also contemplating whether I need to stock up on specific equipment or resources to handle various potential challenges.

581,1695460216.0,Thank you for not being these campers. Seriously.,"Hey all you beautiful campers! I wanted to say thank you to all of the amazing people on here who are fabulous at sharing the outdoors with others. We just got back from 1 week at our favorite local state campground we go to instead of therapy. I feel like I need therapy now because of it.

It's finally the time of year you can be one of the only people in campgrounds here. I made reservations a few months ago, which everyone can see online when campsites are taken on what dates, right?

Enjoying the peaceful forest, we're the only ones there for a week, out of 60 sites. What a stellar week! But NO...a family of screaming kids has to pull in RIGHT NEXT TO US.  Can anyone tell me why people do this? I have the same reaction when I'm in an empty restaurant and someone comes in and sits right next to me. Maybe I need to be less introverted.

Anyway, while one kid is carrying a Bluetooth speaker and blasting music at 5 million decibels right next to our car in our site, another one starts hacking at the old oak trees with a machete....and then starts chasing squirrels with it while screaming. And then starts eyeing our two little dogs. I asked the parents as nicely as possible to put their wild primates in check, and they told me to go fuck myself. When the kids started throwing gravel at our car and the ""adults"" thought it was cute while they threw another beer can in the bushes, I called the ranger. They actually kicked them out double time. But we ended up leaving that evening because they knew where we were, and I'm feeling paranoid.

So, to all of you pleasant, ettiquette-minding campers, a great big THANK YOU.

Edit: Thanks everyone for making me feel like I'm not hypercritical :D. I should also add that they didn't have a reservation (I checked the website too) but they drove around and looked at all the sites first. We always keep our dogs quiet and set up a dog fence around our seating area as well, don't play music etc. I was half joking about camping for therapy...but we are both first responders and quiet camping time is really important, which is why when we go to actual campgrounds we go in the off season or check the availability maps. I realize people and kids make noise...but this felt like it was going to turn into The Hills Have Eyes kind of crap.",camping

What are some really nice/friendly/wholesome experiences you've had with your neighbors and fellow campers over the years?

tldr: old lady recently widow(er?)ed is nice to us and everyone has a nice experience

I have a ton but one that always sticks in my mind despite being well over 20 years ago was camping at a little campground in WNC by a river.  Pit toilet, not a lot of sites, pretty out of the way in a national forest.  I was probably like 10 or 11 at the time and when we showed up there was nobody else there at all. We took a really sweet site by the river and got situated etc.

A few hours later a probably 70+ old lady with a little 80s pop up camper trailer and extremely nice sweet old grandma energy shows up and pulls up by our site and in a totally non grumpy way exclaims ""yall took my favorite spot!"" which makes sense because it was a really great spot.  She asked us if we minded helping her back her trailer in to the adjacent site because her husband had recently passed and this was her first time out at their favorite campground since.  My dad backed her trailer in and we went back to doing our own thing.

A few hours later she comes over and invites us over for dinner which was pork and beans.  She had an absolutely huge pot of beans and probably like a dozen hot dogs cut up into it which I remember being amused by considering she was just one little old lady but I guess she was hoping for some company.  We accepted even tho we already had eaten and hung out at her site with her for a while, she kinda just seemed like she wanted to talk to people and was sweet as can be.  I remember thinking she reminded me exactly of my grandmother who was your typical sweet old rural Alabama old lady.  

She ended up telling us about how she and her late husband had been going to this pretty out of the way campground for the last 40 years or something (since 1959 or some shit) and had a ton of stories about it etc.  The one I remember is her talking about a flash flood on the river (this campground was in a valley along a river) with some kid about my age probably 30 years previous fishing on the river and her husband basically running down and grabbing him up before the water got too high since the kid didn't realize the gravity of what was going on.  She said the flood came up the banks and wiped out all of the lower few sites along the river in a matter of like 10 minutes.

We probably spent an hour with this lady tops but it was just such a friendly and wholesome interaction that I still think about it in my mid 30s despite this probably being late 90s or so.  She came by a few more times to thank us again for helping her out with the trailer and stuff.  I like to think we made her weekend a little better because she really seemed like she needed some human interaction (judging thru my adult lens of what I was largely unconcerned with at the time as a 10 year old who mostly just wanted to go move rocks around in the river).

Bonus story: much more recently I was camped next to some old graybeard motorcycle dudes with choppers, an American flag on a pole they literally planted into the dirt in their campsite etc, Vietnam vets I think.  My brother and I were walking down to the creek to try to catch some trout, they yelled something like good luck as we walked past.  As luck would have it we pretty much immediately caught a decent trout big enough to eat so we were walking back with a good sized trout all of 20 mins later to cook up.  Dudes were so pumped about this (they were deep in drink at this point despite it being about 3 in the afternoon) they practically lobbed a few beers at our head so we brought them over some of the trout snack after we cooked it up on a plank by the fire

I went to cabelas and bought the ascend-lightweight-cot-blue. More than I planned to spend but it was what was avaliable and had a good return policy. I’ve fallen in love. It packs down super small and is very light. It’s light to the point I would backpack with it. 

Issue is, while I work I’ve noticed it makes my dog very happy. I want to get him a cot for camping. But I also want it to be light and packable. 

Only reason I wouldn’t buy a second one is price, at some point I can eat that cost but curious if anyone has a good packable dog cot that would fit for him coming to work with me and would also be used in our big tent. 

He can very much sleep on the floor, he’s just so damn happy in my cot.

740,1694930593.0,DIY 12v battery shower,"Hi all

I just finished making my own 12 volt completely portable battery powered shower.

It is made from the following parts:

- 20L plastic jerry can
- 12V camp shower kit
- a battery clip to suit Milwaukee 18V M18 battery
- an 18V to 12V DC converter
-12V push button switch
- some 3mm acrylic sheet bent into a gear tray
- neoprene adhesive sealant gasket tape

I cut a large hole in the top so the submersible pump would  fit in. Then I drilled some holes for the nylon compression glands to reticulate the shower hose and pump cable out of.

Next I cut & moulded the piece of acrylic which would act as a gear tray to mount the electrics, as well as a removable cover for the hole so that the pump can be removed for repair or replacement.

I mounted and wired up the switch, battery clip, and DC converter.

All new penetrations through the jerry can have been sealed with neoprene gasket material.

It is not 100% waterproof but it is waterproof enough that it won't spill water in your vehicle on a rough trail, as long as it stays right way up.

To use it, all you need to do is boil some water to add to the cold water inside, plug in a charged Milwaukee M18 battery onto the red clip, carry to where you want to use it, and press the button to operate the pump.

I also have a drop down table on my Jeep tailgate so I leave the jerry can in the rear of the Jeep and use it for washing dishes etc after cooking. 

I think all up it cost me about $100 AUD (roughly $65 USD). It was quite an easy project with just a drill, Dremel, soldering iron, heat gun to bend the plastic and heat shrink wires, and basic hand tools needed.",camping

771,1694814665.0,A Sleeping Pad That Doesn't Deflate,"Ladies and Gentleman,

Over the course of 15 years of camping, cycling, hiking and being outdoors most of the time. I have yet to encounter a blow up sleeping pad that has not, at some point, failed. I do not even recall the names of these sleeping pads at this juncture.

As I lay, on yet another dying pad, I think to myself. Gee, I might be getting up there in the high end price range where maybe it's worth investing in a quality grade sleeping mat. However, I am still of the opinion, and I think of this in many respects of my life, IT WILL BREAK. No matter what. 

Has anyone ever made it through more than, sheesh, idk, 2 years with the same sleeping pad? With no holes? And using it regularly?

I'm actually going on a YEAR with a PowerLux Dumb Pad, and it was the longest running one I've ever had. However, after starting a bicycle trip; I'm two months into a trip from Nordkapp, Norway to Cape Town, South Africa, I have yet another casualty of the open road. Sport Outlets in Norway have essentially the same pad for roughly $20-$30 and I'm thinking about doing that again. Or submerging the pad in the pond I'm sleeping next to tonight and finding the hole..

Opinions! Please. :)",camping

799,1694728297.0,How to still enjoy camping when the isolation and silence is gone?,"Hello, everyone.

I'm a long time camper, hiker and general outdoorsy person. Part of what I used to enjoy the most about the outdoors was just getting away from people and noise. I am fairly introverted person, so I just feel like I need to get away from people, noise and busy city life in order to recharge myself. Unfortunately, that is just rarely the case anymore. It just seems every year that outdoors hobbies, especially camping, just keep increasing in popularity. I started noticing the popularity increase a bit before COVID and it just sky rocketed after COVID, at least where I like to go (west Texas, east and north New Mexico and all over Arizona). Having read similar stories here and other subs, I know I'm not the only one experiencing this.

Anyway, in an effort to experience quiet and isolation again, I have been trying to get more and more remote and off trail. It is definitely better, but I still encounter people and often obnoxious ones (from my view point anyway). For example, I tried to take up dispersed camping recently, which is less crowded for sure, but it's not an escape. The last night of my most recent dispersed camp, a couple of dudes should up at like 9 pm and were making tons of noise setting up while talking and laughing loudly. While not ideal, I can overlook that. Unfortunately, they started playing extremely loud music (like small concert loud) at 10:30 pm. From what I have been reading on this sub lately, it seems like a lot of people are experiencing similar or worse including theft and threatening behavior while dispersed camping.

So, long story short, I have accepted that I can't escape people or noise anymore. That's just the current reality. However, I would still like to enjoy the outdoors. My question for all the other campers out there is have you found a way to to still enjoy camping without the quiet and isolation? This question is specifically for people who enjoy the isolated and quiet aspect of camping. I get noise and people don't bother many of you. For those who like the quiet, how have you continued to enjoy the outdoors with the quiet gone (if it has gone away like it has for me)?

Edit: Going more remote hasn't helped as I mentioned, so that's why I'm asking how people still have fun camping when it's not quiet. I have accepted people will always be present

Edit 2: I'm not complaining. I fully understand we ""share"" the outdoors with other people. I have never asked anyone I have encountered to leave, to keep quiet or been rude to them in any way. Like I said, I have accepted people will always be around. I want to continue enjoying the outdoors despite that.

Edit 3: Once again, I have gone dispersed camping and tried going more remote. People still show up. Not to mention seedy activity goes on at dispersed campsites as others have mentioned. The southwest US seems to have become very popular. Why? I don't know. I guess the southwest is hot right now (no pun intended). Anyway, that's why I am not asking how to find more quiet, just how to still enjoy the outdoors with people present. Regardless, thanks for all the helpful ideas. Backpacking is definitely a consideration of mine but it is time consuming, and I don't have a lot of gear and can't afford to buy a lot of gear. Still willing to try it out if I can get my wife onboard. Weekday camping is also definitely a consideration but both my wife and I work day jobs and we don't get a ton of leave time. It's hard for us just to take a week off and disappear. If we can though, I'm sure we will find more peace and quiet. I will also try checking out other states like Utah, Nevada, California etc. Again, getting the time off is an issue though. I will also give Hicamp a look. Thank you everyone, appreciate it.",camping

807,1694704892.0,Can you help us grasp how windspeed (~15mph) translates to force on tents and canopies?,"We’re heading to a festival in Mass this weekend, about 80 miles east of Boston. Weather Underground is predicting 10 – 16 mph winds but no rain.  I've never really looked at wind speeds in isolation, so I don't have a concept of how numbers translate to lived experience.   

We have a basic 6-person Coleman tent and a 13' pop-up. 

The tent gets staked down at all points and has done us well thus far in a few heavyish storm, but again I have nothing to compare it to (i.e. was that “wow, that was windy!” a 5 mph or 15 mph situation?). 

The pop-up takes two stakes per leg. In rainstorms, we pull the corner canopy extensions (the short poles that expand the canopy from 10' to 13') and drop the legs down so it's about four feet off the grown rather than fully up. 

None of that protects from other canopies or tents that have taken flight, of course. 

Are 15 mph winds likely to wreak havoc across the festival? A few lost tents and whatnot here and there but generally just very gusty? 

We usually stake so the stake angle is either opposite the rope it's holding (i.e. so it forms an acute angle between the rope and the ground) and in two different angles in each pop-up leg. Any advice on improving that? 

Lastly, since we're going to be staking the heck out of things, any advice on how to get those straight stakes (the ones with a slightly larger top, not with a hook to it) out of the ground when it's time to go? They're usually difficult, but I imagine over-securing things is likely to make it a nightmare to pull them up, especially those that are flush with the metal legs of the pop-up.

830,1694628305.0,New to camping. Just sayin’ hi.,"
Hey all, new to camping but me and my partner are really looking forward to getting into it. I bought a Basecamp 6 tent from REI (half price, baby!) and I’m slowly sourcing gear. My goal is to go camping next (late) spring for the first time. We live in Rhode Island so I’m thinking our maiden trip will be in New England. 

For our first few trips, we’d like to car camp on a campground. That way, we can work out the kinks and figure out what we need and what we don’t need. Our preference would be for camp sites that are somewhat isolated from each other, but with access to bathrooms/showers. 

I have heard of a few campgrounds that only allow tents. There’s something I like about that. We don’t have kids so playground amenities or “entertainment” really isn’t exciting to us. We’re going to have some peace and quiet, with a few comforts and luxuries.  

After that, we’d like to really see what is out there for camping. I think we’d both like to see a mixture of different camping experiences like backpack camping, disperse camping, and hot tent camping. 

So far I’ve been bringing myself up to speed by watching YouTube videos on different things to keep in mind, types of gear, etc. and though I really like watching, I am going to have a ton of questions. That’s why I want to say hi to all you awesome people. 😀",camping

832,1694625744.0,Question about dew and bugs - tentless camping in 60°F weather,"I just finished building a big playset for my kids ([this is it](https://i.imgur.io/FkthxGo_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium), I know I still have to finish one level, I'm going to finish it at a later date), and I told my kids when it was done we would camp out on it. It seemed like a fun thing to do, and they're excited about it. Now that it's almost time to do (we are doing it this Friday night), I'm starting to think about the logistics of it and worrying myself a bit haha

With it being on the playset, we obviously can't do a tent, so I planned on just putting a pad down and sleeping in a tent under the stars. But I'm wondering how the dew and bugs will affect us. I live in Kentucky near the woods, for the record. The bugs currently are a pain during the day, but at dusk they seem to chill out, but I don't know if they will start bugging (excuse the pun) us after we stop moving, and not sure if bug spray alone will do the trick.

As far as dew goes, the ground definitely gets wet, but if we are elevated 5-10 feet (depending on which floor we are sleeping on), will that still be an issue? If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it. I want it to be fun, and I don't want my poor kids to wake up wet and full of bug bites!",camping

834,1694623246.0,Walking through your camp,"TLDR: guy walks through my campsite to fish and says I'm the asshole when I tell him it is rude.

I want to check to see if I was rude in this situation.   The other day I was at a BLM campsite.  This spot has 4 camp sites, they are quite obvious from a fireplace and stone picnic table.  Since this location is by a river two of the camp spots have little paths people have picked through to get to the water.  One path is roughly 10-15 feet long and the other is about 35ft long.  There is also a boat ramp with extra parking right by the bathroom.

I got there super early and picked one of the camp spots with water access.  It was the edge of a hill, the picnic table, about 3 ft from that the firepit, then 4 ft from that my truck bed.  So i was in the spot and relatively compaxt.  I was in camp putting a few things in the truck about to walk the dog when all of a sudden a big yellow lab comes walking into my camp.  Right after that a guy comes up and goes we are just going to the fishing spot.  He walks right past me, between the fire pit and my truck, then to the path that leads to the water.  I was kind of dumbstruck but still took my dog on a walk.  A minute later I saw his friend and asked to confirm.   I told him it was quite rude to walk through a camp spot to fish.  He said they would watch out but then when I got to camp it was obvious he had went through it to go meet his buddy.

A little later the original guy came through and basically said I was wrong for saying it was rude.  I told him he can't just walk through a camp site, one that is at a designated spot, when somebody is there.  I told him it was extremely rude and asked what if my dog was the aggressive type?  He tried to say he was a local so that's what they do but I don't quite believe that part.  He also hinted that if he didnt have his 2 year old strapped to his chest there would be a fight.  I've camped around the country and never had somebody do this.

To add one more piece of information, his friend didn't come back through my camp.  There was a larger, recreation area 125 yards down the road.  In the river they were literally closer to the water access at that recreation area and not the camping area so his friend exited that way.

So basically, am I an asshole or am I right in thinking that guy was full of shit and rude for doing that?",camping

837,1694619887.0,Older Clip Flashlight 2-Person Tent Question,"I just picked up an old(er) Clip Flashlight 2-person tent because it's exactly what I was looking for and since it was older/used it didn't break the budget at all.

I set it up in my yard. I put down a cheap ground tarp and set the tent up on top of it - then sprayed it down with a hose to check if it was leaky or needed some waterproofing / resealing. The fly seemed to be waterproof - but there was some pooling coming from the floor. I don't know a lot about tents; can this be solved by 're water proofing' this or have I wasted my money?

Since the tarp extended beyond the fly, the water was caught and 'pooled up' directly under the tent, which may have been part of the reason - but I would figure the base of most tents should be able to hold up to something like that, no?

Is there another test I can try? I just want to make sure I don't wake up soaked if it rains while I'm using this tent :) 

Any advice appreciated.

I've camped allot in my life and allot more in the last year or 2, more or less full-time over the last 6 months due to life circumstances, maybe I've just been able to avoid people that much that I've never had an issue with noisy neighbors but this current spot Im at has a couple that seemingly stays up the entire night talking and laughing, they rolled in Monday morning at 4am slamming doors & yelling at each other. Woke up around 3am this morning to them laughing at the top of their lung, talking loudly, Tiktok blaring and they didnt quiet down until 5 and then right back at it around 6. 

It's dispersed camping so sure there really aren't any rules but I think its common decency to be quiet at those hours. Half asleep after listening to them for an hour I sat up and yelled out ""Hey, shut the f up"" twice but they either didn't hear me or didnt care. Walked over this morning mostly to apologize for yelling out at them, everyone I've met at this spot has been overly friendly so I thought it might just be a chance to strike up a conversation but the guy wasn't having it so I just asked kindly to keep it down at night, this guys partner jumps out of the car like a rabid dog ""nobody gives an f, we dont care about your sleep nobody gives an f I'm gonna run you over with my car"", I had to have had my mouth agape I was just shocked like wtf...

861,1694548719.0,Coleman Carlsbad review,"
I purchased the Coleman Carlsbad 4 person tent for use camping at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival this past weekend. For those who don't know, it ended up a shit show, one of the major problems being a massive out of nowhere spinoff storm that did a ton of damage to tents cars and canopies. 

I initially bought this tent because I liked the screened in porch, and I figured the darkroom technology would be useful in case we wanted to sleep in a little bit after long nights without the sun shining in our faces. That feature did turn out to be the second best aspect of the tent - not because of the sun, but because we ended up being camped directly underneath one of those massive generator lights. It was like camping beneath a mini sun, but yet when we crawled into bed each night, you'd never know the blazing glow of the only thing that worked at that festival was there. 

The best feature was by far the waterproofing. If you've seen some reviews saying the screened in area is not at all waterproof, those complaints are definitely true. It could use some additional setup to help keep some of the water out, but it was perfect for leaving our already wet clothes, and honestly having a slight second layer of security to the tent opening setup. Beyond the porch layer of the tent though, the waterproofing was phenomenal. Neighbors all around us were blowing out of the ground and flooding and some were literally flying through the air, but not the Coleman Carlsbad. We stayed dry, even *with the windows open* at times. We didn't even have a tarp layer down under the tent.

Additional perks: the pockets on the back side were super handy and nicely sized for storing everything from water bottles and charging phones to medications, and the top hook was perfect to add a light and fan for the heat. We didn't end up using the screened in area (see: rain and also 7' tall friend who wouldn't fit) but it would have been great if there were bugs and better weather. My husband did end up taking a nap in there on one of the drier days lol. 

Cons: I really don't have a lot of complaints, but one thing I will say is the entrance to the screened in area definitely needs a way to be staked down in the middle, because otherwise you need two hands to get out and idk about y'all but I don't have the brain power to use both hands at 7am.

Recommendations: I would definitely recommend a tarp under the tent and an additional rain fly setup for the screened in area if you're anticipating wet weather and want that part to be dry. I would also recommend heavier duty tent stakes - while the majority of the stakes we used held up to the rain and wind of the storms (only one came out and it probably wasn't in right), a number of them bent as we tried to stake the tent down (which is probably why the one wasn't in right), so honestly we're definitely springing for something larger and stronger next time.

Overall, 9.5/10 for the Coleman Carlsbad, I may never buy another tent again",camping

Am new to this subreddit but have been camping for years across the US. Am curious to know if anyone has had a similar experience, or advice for something that happened last weekend. 

Basically, I was camping in a state park (a full state park, families and other campers all around) by myself, as a female. I woke up at 330 AM Saturday night/Sunday morning to find the lone male camping next door to me walking next to my tent and staring down at me. I freaked out, and left. 

No matter how long I try to steel man his behavior, I just can't come up with a reason why he would: 

1. be on my campsite at all, at 330 am no less. our sites are large and would not be incidental that he'd traversed from his site to mine

2. be where he was standing, which is directly next to my tent in the least reasonable place to be standing (just a sliver of space between tent and picnic bench, but closest space to my head) if he was genuinely just trying to walk across my site 

3. looking down into my tent watching me, as i was sleeping

I've gone camping by myself once and found it kinda fun. Slightly lonely but overall really enjoyed it. 

I've since moved country and now the only campsite I can find have all the bells and whistles. 
Even the basic campsites in this country have kids clubs, toilets and shower blocks. 
Not what I wanted at all. 

If I just set up my tent in the garden and sleep in that for a few nights. As a single adult. Does that come across as sort of pathetic? 

With a house right there etc. 

But I kinda liked the whole sleeping in the tent, curled up in my sleeping bag, cooking my food on my little heater etc 

But at the other campsite I went hiking around the woods and relaxing by the tent etc. 

Is it a little pathetic to just be sat in my garden reading a book ?

911,1694384148.0,Obnoxious campers in Shenandoah,"After 30+ years in a tent, last night was definitely one of my least enjoyable nights. We were in Shenandoah and the group next to us had 4 cars parked on a spot. (Two on the grass.) A ranger came by and told them to move two cars and buy another spot. They did, but only parked the cars there and set up tents in the same camp. Long story short, at about 12 am they started drunkenly screaming and slamming car doors until 430 a.m. The campground hosts did nothing. Finally, at 430, the surrounding tents starting yelling, shut the \*\*\*\* up, in near unison and they went to bed. However, instead of going to tents they got into their Teslas and left them running for a few hours.

A few surrounding campers said they had repeatedly asked the group to be quiet throughout the night to no avail.

After we broke camp, my wife and I walked over to group and I kindly explained how disrespectful they had been to the entire campground. They were speaking in Chinese, but definitely knew English (talking to me and ranger). I said after years of camping I had never experienced such a disrespectful group and they come back to be more considerate to others in the site. The guy said whatever and walked away so I simply said I will let the ranger station on the way out in hopes they would issue a fine. He said, ""Go ahead"", so I did. Not only where they loud, but they also did not follow bear procedures. They ruined at least a dozen campers night and its not insignificant getting into Shenandoah sites (30 to reserve; 20 to enter or use a park pass).

Thankfully, another couple complained at the ranger station at the same time and they said they would send a ranger to the site. I think a fine is the only way future campers might have a better experience next to this group.

I was thinking about a solo road trip with my dog to go camping up North. I mentioned this to a friend and he offered to let me camp on a piece of property he owns near the Canadian border. He showed it to me once, it's a beautiful spot directly on the water surround by trees on the other three sides, with a picnic table, an eco-friendly outhouse, a small rowboat and then nothing else but the Loons, it's a great spot.

But I got sidetracked with a few important projects at home and time is getting away from me. He emailed today to say he bought camp wood to leave on the property for me, but that if I'm going I should not delay because it'll be too cold soon. Or that I should go next summer. I guess I forgot how much colder it can be up North, especially on the water. It's not really a matter of gear, I have all-season gear, but I don't like cold weather camping and neither does my Senior dog. I want to do it when it's warmer; so it's right now or next year. 

I'd have to set aside projects, throw my tent and some gear in the vehicle and go without much planning, which is hard for me because I'm a 'planner'.

925,1694349744.0,Tips for making tent poles out of wood dowels,"Recently, I've started using a tarp for shelter and I'd like to make a couple tent poles out of wooden dowels that I can pack away with my tarp. It is easy enough to find a stick to use as a pole, but I'd like to make something to keep as a permanent part of my kit. I could buy a collapsible pole, but I want to make them.

Have any of you ever made your own tent poles? How did you do it and what did you use? I'm thinking about using hardwood dowels and some type of pipe connector. I'd like to make 2-4 poles that are about 4 feet long and have interchangeable sections that can be used to vary the length of the pole set. Maybe making each section 12-18 inches (30-45 cm). 

What are your ideas, or what have you made?

Edit: These poles will not be used in a dome tent and will not need to bend. I guess ""dowel"" has different meanings to different people. So to clarify, I'd like to use a wooden set of oak poles to make a collapsible set of oak poles. The diameter is still up for debate.

Edit 2 (The Great Bamboo-zling): Bamboo is a great material and is actually slightly harder than oak. However, bamboo has some serious drawbacks for the use intended here. First, bamboo is incredibly flexible and strong... when it's green. Once bamboo dries, it becomes hard and brittle. Think about a sailing ship's mast, if it were made of green bamboo it would bend all over the place. And, if it were made of dry bamboo, it would snap and shatter. The poles I'm trying to build are kinda like a ship's mast, except they won't need to bend anywhere near as much as a ship's mast does.

Edit 3: I have never heard of anyone using bamboo for anything other than gardening or decorating until today.",camping

At this point i know that theres some more i could use in this but im really drawing a blank, and am looking for your folks input as to what i might be missing or forgetting, or a suggestion on what might be a better piece of kit in this. I'm not going for ultra light but i may at some point. The mentality ive taken with what im getting is to not cheap out on stuff like pack, tent, and sleeping gear, but not to go nuts as this is my first forey. 

For the rest of the stuff im figure id go about mid range for most on this trip, and upgrade what breaks or may not work, or to find a different item to fill the purpose instead. And if it works well for a low price, keep using it.

Any suggestions or input?",camping

942,1693583891.0,What to do with outdoor gear you don’t need anymore.,"I work/live in a National Park in the U.S. and this year more than any year I have noticed an alarming amount of outdoor gear thrown away into trash cans. I’m not talking like, a broken tent pole, I’m talking about entire tents, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, backpacks, etc. And I get it- we’ve been seeing a ton of international visitors this year who likely can’t bring back all of the items they purchased for their trips. Or, perhaps, people are going camping and deciding they hate it and never want to do it again.  No judgement. Yesterday though I ran into a group throwing away a bunch of totally fine gear, and stopped and asked why. They said they didn’t know what else to do with these things since they can’t take them home with them due to limited space.

I am posting here today- **if you are traveling or wind up with outdoor gear you cannot take with you or do not want anymore that is still usable, please consider donating it to a non profit in need or taking it to a local thrift-store or consignment shop** (you can even get money back for this!) 

Another option too is to stop in at the Visitor Center at the National Park/National Forest you are visiting and ask if they have any need for the items you don’t want any more- a lot of parks have backcountry programs or work with conservation corps/youth corps that could utilize the gear!  

To make this even easier for anyone that might be in this situation, I did a google search for different organizations and companies in the United States that take in used outdoor gear, and here are some that I found:

For more information on recycling/donating gear, click [here](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-retire-gear.html).

An option to consider too- instead of purchasing new gear for your trips, [consider renting](https://www.rei.com/stores/rentals)! REI has many rental options and locations available. There may be small local gear shops that rent equipment where you are traveling too. This is also a great way to try out gear you might be considering purchasing back home. 

If none of these work for you and your travels, consider dropping your gear off at any local thriftstore or larger ones such as Goodwill/Salvation Army/Savers/Deseret Industries etc., since used gear going to any of these is still better than ending up in a landfill. Thanks all!

**ETA:** holy smokes, y’all. I had no idea this would blow up like it did. And thanks for my first awards ever! There’s been some amazing suggestions in the comments, so I wanted to add them to my list. **Feel free to DM me if you know of a non-profit accepting gear donations and I will add it to this list.** I’m going to hold off on posting more consignment shops **because there’s a lot of them** but visit the link I posted above for a comprehensive list by state someone has already put together!

[NON-PROFIT Scouts of America](https://beascout.scouting.org)- Nationwide. Reach out to a local scouting organization to see about donating gear!

[PEER-TO-PEER EQUIPMENT RENTALS Geer Garage](https://geergarage.com)- Seattle, WA 

A lot of folks mentioned donating gear to help the homeless. I highly recommend checking out the [National Coalition for the Homeless directory](https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org) to find a shelter where you are traveling from that might be in need to donate to. [GearJunkie](https://gearjunkie.com/winter/old-gear-homeless-donation) also has a great article on this. 


Another option before buying gear- check with your local library or the library where you are visiting about potential gear rentals. Some libraries also allow you to check out Park passes! Just another reason to love them. ❤️

Finally, I want to add that increasing gear availability and supporting initiatives aimed at promoting accessibility to all is community health- both when it comes to the natural world and the human side of things. And the more people we have that are passionate about protecting wild spaces and advocating for the outdoors we all love, the better.

954,1697465322.0,Is it better to use a air mattress or cot in cold weather?,"I am taking my son camping for the first time. And we will be going between November - March, probably fairly often. Which is due to astrophotography. And in my area temperatures in the winter can drop to single digits. Although we don't plan to go if night time temps drop below 25F. I am trying to gather up gear now, and being mindful to pick up more ""serious"" choices due to trying not to die (lol). 

Anyways I haven't been camping in many years... in fact probably 30 (Boy scouts). And back then no one used air mattresses. I think we all pretty much used foam. But I have read that you need something more substantial for cold weather. So while browsing I am coming across a lot of light weight air mattresses, and cots. We won't be backpacking in somewhere, so weight isn't an issue.

Probably will have to wait until next year but would like to start researching now. 

There is a fairly new group a few hours from me in ATL, but they only do it for a day or two and its always on the days I work.  I will still keep trying to join them one day. I have been waiting forever to go on my first camping trip, met a girl group here on reddit and on tiktok that I joined to go on a group trip with, but both ended up canceling the event for various reasons. I have been buying equipment for awhile now. 

Thought I would find a guy that would take me camping but no such luck, last ex despised the outdoors was a musician and stayed in clubs,  no wonder that didnt workout. So, I dont want to simply wait until my next relationship to try to go again. 

Everytime I think a trip is going to happen it gets canceled for some reason that has nothing to do with me. And no, I do not want to just go by myself, especially not the first time or just do it in my backyard. I want a real camping experience with people that have the knowledge and expertise.

[Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov) updated information on our reservation to reflect a 10am check-in and a 9:30am check out.

But what about plastics, paper/plastic hybrids, etc? Is burning those a grievous sin as well? I understand chemical by-products released from burning things such as plastic outside of the proper facilities, but is my one weekend of camping really affecting things?

Edit: I appreciate the replies, even the ones that come off as condescending. To clarify a couple of things:

I was raised in the woods far removed from civilization. I have a healthy respect for nature and preserving it. The fact that I’m asking the question and wanting to improve my understanding/practices should somewhat reflect that. 

The camping I’m referring to is at a public campground in the center of my city. It has a dedicated fire pit. It’s not backcountry or very remote. I can drive my car 3 minutes and be in the nearest neighborhood. I’m not trying to diminish the importance of LNT, but the footprint of humanity is here regardless of my participation in good/bad practices. 

I agree with anyone who says the mentality of “what I do doesn’t matter,” is a bad state of mind. However, I am a realist at heart and believe that until we fix the pollution caused by large corporations, whether or not we individually dedicate our lives to green living doesn’t matter and the 1% are going to cause more environmental damage than we ever could.",camping

1019,1697223577.0,New California campsite reservation law,"Finally, a good step in the right direction for the California campground reservation system.

""You could be banned from California campgrounds for bailing on your campsite reservation"" 

""A new bill signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsome aims to deter no-shows, including banning repeat offenders.

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan introduced Assembly Bill 618. It makes several changes to how California State Parks (CSP) will handle camping reservations.

The law states that campers must cancel their booking seven days before arrival. Those who don’t will lose their reservation fee, the cost of the first night’s stay and will incur an $8 cancellation fee. If campers don’t show up by the day after their reservation date, the CSP will cancel the remaining days on their reservation. If a camper is a no-show three or more times in a calendar year, CSP can ban them from making new reservations.

To make it easier for campers to make reservations, the law makes campsites more available by limiting the number of days people can stay at the same campsite in a year to 30 and limits the length of reservations during peak season to seven consecutive nights. The bill will also implement a lottery system by 2025 for five of the most popular park campsites, to be determined by the CSP based on advanced booking interest.

The new laws take effect January 1, 2024""

1041,1697090043.0,Have you had any scary or life-threatening experiences while camping?,"Back in 2021 my husband and I were camping in Wyoming at the Boysen Reservoir. We got really lucky and were able to book a “beach” front site, directly leading to the water but the downside was that it was very, very far away from the other campsites. We were essentially isolated from everyone else, at the time though it sounded like a dream come true. 

The thing about Wyoming is that it’s so desolate to the point where it’s pitch black and eerily dead silent once the sun is gone. We set up our camp, enjoyed our fire, but shortly after that, a random SUV with blacked out windows came driving down our road and into our site. 

They drove towards us, my husband tried to wave to them in case they were lost and needed help, but instead they ignored us and drove down to the beach, stayed there for 5 minutes, turned around and went back up the way they came. 

We immediately got a bad vibe, my husband told me to throw everything in the car and he kept shining a flashlight towards the beach because we had a feeling they dropped someone off to watch us. After we packed up we got in the car and hauled ass. Lo and behold, the same car drove back into our campsite and when they saw us leaving, they actually started chasing us. Mind you, the roads in Wyoming are bumpy and unkept when you’re in the wilderness- on top of that, enormous wildlife that wanders in and out of the streets. My husband said “I have to go fast, are you ok with that?” And I said “just go and get us out of here.” 

We were easily going 80mph down these windy roads and even through a canyon, they were on our tail for about 10 mins until we lost them after passing through the canyon. Most terrifying experience of our lives, we think about it to this day and wonder what could’ve happened if we didn’t listen to our gut at that moment.

Edit: wow! I had no idea this would blow up. To those who shared their stories and experiences like this post was intended for, thank you. 
To those who made it a debate about guns, you do you- but I want to live, and not be ignorant to the fact that dangerous people do, in fact, exist. 

And to those who claimed I’m either lying or paranoid- for one, we tried to engage with them, but these folk barreled past us without a word. First red flag. Two, our site was so isolated, why would anyone pull up to our campsite just to sit at the beach for a few minutes and then leave? You can’t drive across the sand to the other campsites because of the water, so if you’re coming to our site, you’re doing it for a reason. Second red flag.

1060,1697101420.0,Preparing carefully before every trip is necessary,"During a camping trip in the Adirondack Mountains, we faced an unexpected challenge when one of our group members sprained their ankle while hiking. This taught us the importance of being prepared. We had to administer first aid, improvise a splint from materials at hand, and carefully help the injured member back to camp. It underscored the value of having basic medical skills and an emergency plan.

In addition, we encountered a heavy rainstorm that lasted for two days, testing our gear and resolve. Our tent developed a small leak, which we had to patch with a repair kit we had brought. We also learned how crucial it is to properly secure food to prevent encounters with wildlife like bears.

This experience was a stark reminder of the unpredictability of the wilderness and the necessity of thorough planning and preparedness. It made me more aware of the importance of having the right equipment and knowing how to use it, as well as understanding the unique challenges of the environment you're camping in.",camping

1065,1697195838.0,Camping tip: read the campground and act accordingly,"I’m a digital nomad so I’m pretty much solo camping full time.   While I try to beans remote as possible, there are times I have to pay for a site in a state park or similar.  For work reasons, on the east coast I’ve had to spend 11 days at a state park and so I picked the cheapest campground, no utilities and furthest from the rest.  All week it has been peaceful and other campers have been quiet and respectful.  

Enter today.   A family rolls up in two vehicles, and bursts from them yelling, screaming, running, etc.  Not just the kids  but the parents  who are trying to yell over their kids acting like their buddies instead of their parents.    They echo through the whole river valley.  After they get set up, the mother and father break out guitars and start playing and singing LOUDLY as if they are auditioning for American Idol.  This went on for hours.  You could tell they were pissing off everyone else and one camper from the end of the campground yelled SHUT UP.  
I was in the campsite next to these people.  

Point is, take notice of the vibe when you arrive.  Are people partying or is it quiet?   What are other campers doing?   Are they playing music or are they enjoying the serenity of nature?   Don’t be the person that thinks a campsite is an extension of your backyard.  And for the love of god NO ONE wants to hear you perform because you have a captive audience.",camping

I’m sure I could be toasty in my bag and have a great night. 

But during the day? How do you stay warm and not miserable? What do you do while winter camping? Do you do the same as not-cold weather camping - like hiking, staring at the campfire, reading, looking at the stars? Or do you have winter-specific camping activities? Hunting or winter sports?

As much as I dislike the cold, I think a warm and cozy night of sleep in cold weather sounds blissful. It’s that time outside of the sleeping bag I’m trying to understand.

I live in Alberta Canada, so the winter conditions will drop down to -30C (-22F). My summer gear is ultralight and I’d like to do the same with my winter setup, but safety and warmth are my number one priority.  I’ve camped in -34C once before with older gear, and had a blast. 

I’m looking at EE custom sleeping quilts, their Conundrum quilt looks promising! 950pp, It’s rated to -23C (-10F), if I pair that with a sleeping pad with an r-value of 7.3 (NeoAir XTherm NXT Sleeping Pad) would that be comfortable at -30C (-22F)?  I’d be fine wearing multiple layers to sleep in if needed. 

Will I notice a huge difference between a 7.3 (NeoAir XTherm) and an 8 (DURA 8R) r-value? There’s quite a large weight difference between the two.

That's about it. There was no amplified music. I didn't hear any generators. There were no drunken arguments. Honestly, the most exciting thing was a couple deer that passed by.

I don't know if y'all were hoping for some horror story or something; I know Reddit loves drama. Sometimes all that drama is exhausting. Sometimes, you just want to camp in a national park, and see a bunch of stars at night. We saw a ton of stars. The only real negative thing was the price of firewood.

Big Meadows is great. It has a ton of facilities. The meadows are in fact, big. It's near a bunch of cool trails. I get that Shenandoah ain't no Yosemite or even Acadia, but for a lot of people, it's fairly close to where they live.

Some caveats:

* Big Meadows campground is huge. There could have a bunch of loud drunken people blasting music in some other section, who knows.
* It did get down to the mid 30s. Maybe the kind of people who get really wild are the type who can't handle the cold.
* Big Meadows is basically fully booked all the time. You're not gonna walk-in with your stuff

1113,1696878716.0,Lost it on some neighboring campers (rant),"Went camping with the family this weekend (wife, 9 yr old daughter, and 7 yr old son).  Loved everything about the campsite and area, except for the inconsiderate neighbors we had.  Like most campsites, ours had a quite time policy from 10PM - 7AM.  The campsite next to ours had people from at least 3 other campsites gathered there.  Probably at least 10-12 people.  They never really made any effort to be quiet so we weren't surprised when 10:00 rolled around and they kept going as normal.  No music but just talking and laughing very loudly.  Even with earplugs in, they were still going strong at midnight and keeping us up when I finally decided to go say something in not the most polite of ways.  They did quiet down somewhat after that, but at that point I was so pissed I ended up getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep.  My wife and kids didn't fare much better either.  

The next day, between being already being sick and now deliriously exhausted I wasn't in the most tolerant of moods to say the least, nor feeling very kindly towards our inconsiderate neighbors.  As we're eating lunch, we watch them set up some stands that were about 5ft tall about 30 ft apart from each other on the gravel spot for where you would set tents up, put empty glass beer bottles on the stands then proceed to try to knock them off with a frisbee.  As anyone with a few functioning braincells could see happening, it didn't take long for one of the bottles to shatter after falling on the gravel.  Having cut my foot to the bone before on broken glass in a lake and not being able to walk right for months after, I'm a little touchy about people being careless with glass, so I went over said, ""Are y'all fucking retarded?  What are you thinking?  Did you not see that happening?""  (sorry for the ""R"" word).  Not the smartest approach, but I was exhausted, feeling horrible, not thinking straight and really just seeing red at that point like I haven't in many years.  One guy looked like he wanted to fight me, and the others weren't obviously happy about it either.  I typically keep a pretty level head in just about every situation but that was just the perfect storm to really send me over the edge.

I did go back and apologize for that, as I did feel bad for reacting like that but man, I'm just so sick of people being completely inconsiderate of others and careless about things.  The older I get the less patience I have for it.  Anyone who's ever shattered glass should also know there's no way you're ever going to get every last little piece of shattered glass out of gravel.  Even on a hardwood floor you need a vacuum cleaner to make sure you get up all the small pieces.  Sooner or later it's going to get turned up, go through someone's tent and into them.",camping

I usually camp in the Sierras, but since it'll be too cold up there in November we wanted to camp somewhere along the coast. But none of us are very familiar at all with options out there. 

We want to car camp since not all of us have gear for backpacking. It can be a dirt road but not too far or bumpy. Something that will have decent spaces available about a month in advance. We also want to do a campfire, so we don't want anywhere with fire restrictions. We all have sleeping bags down to at least 35F so I believe temp shouldn't be a problem on the coast.

Any suggestions is appreciated!!",camping

1178,1696782317.0,Car camping - Planning a bare bones trip,"A friend of mine and I are planning a cold, late October/early November car camping trip.

Here is the problem, I don't have a tent and money is tight. The budget for the trip all in has to be $500CDN between the two of us. The tent has to fit two large men and keep out the worst of the chill. We both have great sleeping bags and sleeping mats. 

I'm going to be spending $40 on wood. I know a place where I can fill my trunk for that amount, good for the 2 nights we plan to spend. I want to keep food and drinks around $75. The less we spend on food the more we can spend on fun. It'll be at least $30 for gas. I'm going to need propane for the stove so that's another $25. Other than that, all of my gear is in good condition. I have extra blankets, clothes and the like to keep warm.

All said, I'm looking at $170CDN in non-negotiable purchases. That leaves $330 for a tent. 

Blessedly, the campsite is a free provincial site up a gravel road. No expenses there.

As far as food is concerned, we're good with eating rice and canned goods for the trip. 

Any help with the budget or recommendations for a decent tent will be much appreciated! 

As far as entertainment, we plan to fish, read, play board games, and listen to music.

1199,1696606716.0,Better Hot Water solution for group camping!,"I'll start off by saying I'm an engineer and love solving problems with technical solution, even if there really isn't a ""problem"" to begin with - but if you'll indulge me, I think many folks here will enjoy the discussion and ideas.

Most of my camping is now focused on groups of 20+ people due to my son being in Cub Scouts. It's entirely car-camping based but we often do 2-night campouts. 

The ""problem"" is that kids LOVE hot cocoa, and adults like myself sure enjoy coffee and being able to wash utensils with warm water.

As seen in the attached picture, we have taken to using the orange Igloo drink cooler as a hot water on-tap source. People can make their own tea, coffee, or hot cocoa as desired without having to heat an individual serving.

We heat the water with a propane burner and stock pot, which means we have to pick up a boiling pot and dump it into the cooler periodically. It works, but it's less convenient and I feel like only a matter of time before someone has an accident and douses their feet or legs with 2 gallons of scalding water.

But we're now all accustomed to hot water on demand, so I'm wondering if other people have suggestions, even if I have to make them myself?

Ideally, this solution would be :

1) Propane fired
2) Big enough to hold at least 2 gallons of water hot enough to brew coffee .
3) Insulated so as not to constantly burning fuel.
4) Not require electricity, or running water/water pressure.
5) Not involve manual transfer of boiling water from heater to insulated container 

The best thought I can come up with is using a similar beverage cooler with a coil of copper tubing in an external 'chimney' over a propane burner, that would result in convection circulation. 
But I'm curious if anyone else has ideas. Thanks!",camping

We are lucky to live in the most beautiful place in the entire world, so I don't need to travel far to experience natural beauty.  I chose a camp ground 90 minutes from home because I was familiar with it, and it has full mobile reception which I felt was important on my first trip alone. 

My tent is absolutely enormous because we invested in the oztrail 10 person during the Christmas sales and I don't have a smaller one. It was actually relatively easy to set up on my own! I wanted a bit a glamping feel so I brought along my bedding and a few pretty bits from home.  

The best parts of this site for me are the rock slides, (like a naturally formed waterslide) which I spent an entire morning gleefully riding, and also the rock wallabies. There is a rare species of wallaby that only lives in this small region, and this particular colony is friendly to humans and you can hand feed them. The mothers with joeys are usually more reserved but I went out at dusk and had an incredible interaction with a mama who let me stroke her baby in her pouch while she ate out of my hand! 

This was my perfect camping trip. Yes some things would have been easier with my husband but I'm really proud to have done everything by myself!",camping

1211,1696594445.0,How many stakes (pegs) do you use on your tent?,"Hello everyone! I've been reading this subreddit for a while, and I've always been intrigued by the fact that when you set up your tents, you always use all the stakes. Honestly, I never do that. I have a Quechua Air Seconds XL 4.1 (is heavy), and I only use the 4 stakes needed to inflate it and an additional 3 to ensure proper ventilation in the sleeping area. I've never used the other stakes (which I believe are around 8 or 9 more) because I've never seen the need for them, as I've never experienced excessive wind or anything similar.

So, I have a question: Is it necessary to use all the stakes for some reason other than wind? Am I missing something?

When I told them they should ask the people who took their spot to move they said they did ask but that the campground booked them both in the same spot. 

When I said ok but you’re not booked here and you need to leave they said no. Sparing you the details but this man was in his briefs the entire time. So foul. The woman then told me her dad was in the hospital dying…. And I assume I’m supposed to feel bad and give her our spot then? I really don’t know. 

But the late night host number doesn’t work. I called 4 times. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t want them to mess up the campsite or have a fire and we get banned forever because the site is in my name.

We are carrying massive rucksacks (40 - 85l) and I'm not sure where to exactly store them while not taking up space in the tents. The arrangement would be that we are putting our tents up, sleeping for the night, packing it away and moving to the next point; the same cycle for 2 weeks basically.

1227,1696478875.0,How do you FIREPIT?,"My friends and I, we camp all year including in the rain and snow. In bad weather we sit under a tarp.

But there is a problem with sheltering under a tarp and placing the fire OUTSIDE the tarp (which you must do if you like your tarp). The problem is that a circular fire will only warm the 2-3 people who are sitting at the edge of the tarp close to the fire.So, we built a hearth about 5-6 feet wide, alongside the edge of the tarp. We stacked the rocks high at the back and left the front open. The ends of the wall curve inward but then open up to allow more heat to reflect at the ends. It works amazingly. Of course it does require a fair bit of wood because the fire is pretty wide. (See pic)

Another thing we tried recently was to build a platform of stones (about 1 foot high) and then we put our fire on top of the platform. It wasn't a very cold night and it was dry, so we didn't need to think about insulating the heat, etc. This made the fire a little more interactive; the edges of the platform were like a countertop where we could place our foil-wrapped snacks, etc. Also, one corner of the platform was a pretty acute angle, like a spur of stone that you could stand over, with feet on either side, to get REALLY warm.

What have you done to maximize the effectiveness of your hearth build?

We've got a 32 foot travel trailer, if that helps.

We were in Hoosier National Forest, and had an alarm set for 4:30 to start looking for a good site by 5 to give us enough plenty of time to set up camp. We had to settle for a spot that was probably too close to the trail and had to move a bunch of downed wood. On our way out the next day (loop trail) we kept an eye out for future sites, but only saw one ‘maybe’ area. 

The problem is there was a lot of understory of young trees and brambles, and the flexibility of not needing a flat clear spot for a tent (hammock camping) didn’t help much. It’s a shorter trail in terms of backpacking, about 12 miles, but I would have thought there would have been at least one obvious site somewhere on it.

 I am guessing that they are used in the US? 

Can someone define them through descriptions? 

For context, I am Canadian, and these are some terms I use.. (disclaimer there are probably others we use in Canada that I have missed). 

1. Backpacking: Hiking camping while on a trail. Campsites may be designated or not (just a good spot). The land is either a park (Provincial or Federal), or public (Crown).  There is never a picnic table. There might be a tent pad, outhouse, bear box. 

2. Canoe,kayak or bike packing - similar to 1 but on water or by bike. 

3. Car camping: Driving to a designated campground that has designated individual sites. People camp in tents, or may take trailers, RVs or truck & camper combos. 
a) The majority are public: either in parks (provincial or Federal) or around logging leases. Amenities are basic: maybe a few drinking water taps throughout the campground, outhouse toilets, no power or water hook ups. The individual site has a picnic table and fire ring; sometimes a bear box. 
b) There are privately owned ones that have fancier amenities like water and power at each site, buildings with flush toilets and showers.  Sometimes there is a pool and clubhouse. The individual site has at minimum a picnic table and fire ring (to start). 
 
4. Boondocking: Driving out into the bush on a logging or resource road and finding a spot to pull over and camp at. The land is public (crown, or under a logging lease).  Boondockers where I live often seem more likely to have vans or a truck & camper set up than use tents.",camping

1381,1695942949.0,Finally Had First Unsafe Outdoors Experience,"Hey campers!

So...it finally happened. Bummer. 

I (usually a tent camper) rented an a-frame for a small, female-only family trip. Two female adults, two female kid/teens. 

I woke up at 3 am to hear what I think was footsteps outside our a-frame. Gahhhhh. I couldn't see out, but the possible intruder could see in because three sides of the a-frame were made of corrugated plastic. 

I was really scared, especially because I had my two beloved nieces and sister in there with me. 

I stayed inside and kept covered up, in hopes that the intruder would not be able to tell the gender or age of the people inside. 

I didn't pick up my cell to call for help,because I didn't want my face to be illuminated or my female voice to be heard. I also didn't have a way to give emergency responders directions to the a-frame since it was accessed via a path in the woods. 

I stayed awake and tried to breathe calmly, reminding myself that the sun would eventually be up and that MOST people do not get killed or attacked when camping. I also reminded myself that the person had not yet seen fit to attempt entering the structure. 

I'm not SURE it was a person out there. It was raining very hard, which sort of obscured the sound, but it really did sound like a human in hiking boots taking a few steps, pausing a while, and continuing to explore the site. This continued for 3.5 hours. 

We had no items of value, so nothing was taken. 

The a-frame was in the back of the owner's farm, so it wasn't another camper at a neighboring site. 

I mentioned this to the owner, and she didn't explain it away as an animal or anything, like ""Oh there are tons of deer. They walk around at night."" She did say she would look around for footprints and that the day after we left, they found a dead/attacked duck on the property. 

I felt so oddly defenseless in there. Any other campers experience this? I would love any safety tips or insight. I

I'll definitely force myself to stay outside again SOON, but I'm definitely open to any tips on how I could have been better prepared to handle this, especially as a female camper.

Henry Miller said that if we are always arriving and departing, it is also true that we are eternally anchored, that one's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things. I return to his writing often in life, but thought about him constantly while cycling the Pacific Coast again. His library in Big Sur was the destination for my first cross-country bike tour ten years ago, but again a precious checkpoint here and now after traveling thousands of miles from the Arctic Ocean to this journey’s dewy, doughy center.

The hardest days collected en route seem to linger with paralytic hypnosis. I lay awake in the tent at night waiting for sleep while reliving these visions of endless gravel lanes through abandoned territories, ice roads crossed over empty tundra, overgrown trail lines connecting nowhere with nothingness. In hindsight those days feel less like a haunting and more of a moveable feast, holy tokens petrified in wayfaring memoriam, voracious days and weeks wrought with depletion, each static horizon barbed by glacial blades and bergs. Cycling in California is much, much easier.

1421,1695813577.0,[UK Camping Q] - Government Law or Campsite Law?,"Just to preface this question, its not a caravan/ car camping question per say...  


TL:DR Why are people sleeping in cars 'banned' at campsites?

Hi all,

A group of us are off camping in the Peak District next week, 3 of us are regular campers, but our driver, whilst a competent outdoors person, does not have a tent and would like to sleep in the back of their car (not a van/ caravan etc).

The campsite we are staying at says we can leave the car next to where our tents are pitched, but its strictly prohibited to sleep in the car, even though everyone is paying the full price, per person, per tent, per car etc.

I've never been in a position of needing to know the answer to this, as although I usually have my car, I've always camped in a tent...

However, the campsite owner doesn't seem to have a valid reason as to why this is not allowed AND when I have looked at alterative campsites in the area, they all suggest that its not allowed BUT won't give a satisfactory reason as to why not :/

Is there a reason?

I can only surmise that 'maybe' it has something to do with keeping the engine on? My friend has an EV, but I guess its a blanket ban no exceptions, IF indeed that is the reason? But why not just be transparent about why not?

Thanks in advance! :)",camping
1422,1695759838.0,"Didn't open new Core tent right away, it's broken, what to do with it now?"," I  am heartbroken. Saved since May for a dream Core 9 Person Instant tent.  Ordered it in August from Amazon (my first mistake in this story I  guess), hoping to be ready for when the Fall weather hit.

Stupid me - I did not set up the tent at home. I am very familiar with these Core tents and didn't anticipate any issues.

Well,  I took it on a state park trip 2 weekends ago and right out of the bag  it was broken. Three of the upper poles that connect to the side hubs  are split from end to end and one of the poles was backward (the  pushbutton side facing inward). It wouldn't stand, because the way one  of the poles was ""wonky"" in the side hub. It took the help of many  fellow campers as well as a DNR employee to get the tent to  stand...precariously. At one point we had it rigged with twine to tree  branches up above lol. It was either that or just pack up and go home,  wasting vacation days.

As soon as I  got home I emailed Core about the issue. Adding to my heartbreak, as I  worried would happen, I am out of luck. They told me sorry and to return  to Amazon, but it is past the 30 day return window for that. I'm beyond  frustrated (mostly with myself!).

What  can I do with this tent? I do not want it, will never use it again as I  can't trust it to take camping. I am an older solo camper (with dog)  that can't chance getting somewhere and not being able to set up. Lesson  learned, go with a single-hub tent to lessen chance of issues/easier to  prop up and solve if a hub doesn't work (and lesson learned, set up a  tent the second you get it). I had really wanted this larger tent for  myself so that on rainy days I could have a lot of room to hang out -  but I'm glad at least I wasn't several states from home. Now I know to  stick to a tent I can manage myself should something happen. I know you  can order poles and hubs, but at this point I am not interested in  fixing it (like I said, will never trust a multi-hub now) and I don't  have time to be trying to mess with taking something like this apart.

Anyway  - I don't do Facebook, ebay or any of that sort of stuff to try and  sell it and don't know anyone who would want it, as it's technically  broken. Shipping it would probably cost a small fortune even if I wanted  to give it away online. What would be the best way for me to maybe  donate it somewhere (with the caveat that it's broken and someone handy  would have to fix it first)? I hate to just put it out in my trash,  because I'm sure someone mechanically inclined could fix it up. It's a  beautiful tent (if it worked). Advice?

Also - I did try to post this to CampingGear but it didn't make it past the moderation for some reason.",camping

I don't like mummy bags, and I'm not interested in quilts. I've tried both, and neither is for me.

I'm after a bag intended for comfort in 30-40° overnight temps, so I'm guessing a 0° or -10°F survival rating?

All the wide sleeping bags that Google searching turns up are warmer-weather flannel bags for under $100. I have my doubts, let's just say.

I sleep cold and I doubt I'll be camping much once the overnight temps are in the low-30s, but upper-20s is also possible. Yes, I layer up and I'm not in any danger in that regard. I have a decent down bag from REI (house-brand), but it's made for tall people, not wide people, and there's just too much space beneath my feet, but due to my shoulder width and waist size, side sleeping is an issue.

1507,1695460216.0,Thank you for not being these campers. Seriously.,"Hey all you beautiful campers! I wanted to say thank you to all of the amazing people on here who are fabulous at sharing the outdoors with others. We just got back from 1 week at our favorite local state campground we go to instead of therapy. I feel like I need therapy now because of it.

It's finally the time of year you can be one of the only people in campgrounds here. I made reservations a few months ago, which everyone can see online when campsites are taken on what dates, right?

Enjoying the peaceful forest, we're the only ones there for a week, out of 60 sites. What a stellar week! But NO...a family of screaming kids has to pull in RIGHT NEXT TO US.  Can anyone tell me why people do this? I have the same reaction when I'm in an empty restaurant and someone comes in and sits right next to me. Maybe I need to be less introverted.

Anyway, while one kid is carrying a Bluetooth speaker and blasting music at 5 million decibels right next to our car in our site, another one starts hacking at the old oak trees with a machete....and then starts chasing squirrels with it while screaming. And then starts eyeing our two little dogs. I asked the parents as nicely as possible to put their wild primates in check, and they told me to go fuck myself. When the kids started throwing gravel at our car and the ""adults"" thought it was cute while they threw another beer can in the bushes, I called the ranger. They actually kicked them out double time. But we ended up leaving that evening because they knew where we were, and I'm feeling paranoid.

So, to all of you pleasant, ettiquette-minding campers, a great big THANK YOU.

Edit: Thanks everyone for making me feel like I'm not hypercritical :D. I should also add that they didn't have a reservation (I checked the website too) but they drove around and looked at all the sites first. We always keep our dogs quiet and set up a dog fence around our seating area as well, don't play music etc. I was half joking about camping for therapy...but we are both first responders and quiet camping time is really important, which is why when we go to actual campgrounds we go in the off season or check the availability maps. I realize people and kids make noise...but this felt like it was going to turn into The Hills Have Eyes kind of crap.",camping

Hi folks. This  sub has been awesome in helping me grow in my camping journey.

I'm new to this and prepping for some day hikes to build into a short 2 day backpacking trip. I plan on doing short backpacking trips (less than 3 days). Price is a non-factor since I got them for roughly the same price. How can I better test which one is for me? What should I consider

&#x200B;

What I've done so far... I loaded each with pillows and weights so each bag is roughly 28lbs. I simulated weight for my gear. I checked that both were comfortable and that I could fit each pack where I have 80% weight on my back and 20% on my shoulders. I walked around for 10 mins with each bag and went up and down stairs.

&#x200B;

1527,1695482559.0,Pop-up tent for early October camping in the UK?," 

Hi all, I'm really excited about planning my first solo camping trip for early October and had a few questions. I'm really excited to get out there and experience nature firsthand. I only have a 3-4 person pop-up tent - would that be suitable for the conditions then, or is there too much risk of rain/wind?

As a first-time solo camper accessing sites by public transport/a short taxi, I don't mind having to change trains a couple of times, but going from bus to train to bus to train isn't really what I'm looking for. What spots would you recommend that are doable without a car? It would also be nice if there was a pub or small restaurant nearby in case the weather gets too bad - I know, I know, having a backup warm meal option is ""half ass camping"" for you veterans out there, but hey, it's my first time so cut me some slack! I'd love to find a more remote wooded area if possible for the full camping experience, including hopefully getting to warm up around a little fire in the evenings and enjoying the beauty of it getting dark early, settling into my tent with a good book while listening to the sounds of the woods. Nothing like warming up over a little fire, ey?

Additionally, as an inexperienced camper, are there any small, low-cost items I should bring that could make a big difference in comfort? I'm planning on really bundling up in my sleeping bag, but open to any other tips.

With budget and size being a consideration when using public transit, any advice on items that should be prioritised or deprioritised in my packing based on typical October weather?

Lastly, how likely is it I'd run into other campers that late/early in the season? I don't mind being somewhat secluded, but it would be nice to have others nearby just in case. I'm also curious about the rules around extending stays if enjoying my first trip. Like hypothetically, since i know farmers don't really care if you wild camp on their land, would the manager/staff approach me to leave if I overstayed my pitch by a day or two?

Any advice from any level of camping expierience is greatly appreciated! I'm determined to get out there via public transport, but I want to plan carefully since I'm new to camping solo. Let me know your thoughts!

1528,1695436873.0,What are some cool / funny / otherwise positive or uplifting stories you have from camping?,"Feels like this subreddit has been a hotbed of straight up negativity recently with all of the etiquette arguments and whatnot so lets flip the script.  What are some really nice/friendly/wholesome experiences you've had with your neighbors and fellow campers over the years?

tldr: old lady recently widow(er?)ed is nice to us and everyone has a nice experience

I have a ton but one that always sticks in my mind despite being well over 20 years ago was camping at a little campground in WNC by a river.  Pit toilet, not a lot of sites, pretty out of the way in a national forest.  I was probably like 10 or 11 at the time and when we showed up there was nobody else there at all. We took a really sweet site by the river and got situated etc.

A few hours later a probably 70+ old lady with a little 80s pop up camper trailer and extremely nice sweet old grandma energy shows up and pulls up by our site and in a totally non grumpy way exclaims ""yall took my favorite spot!"" which makes sense because it was a really great spot.  She asked us if we minded helping her back her trailer in to the adjacent site because her husband had recently passed and this was her first time out at their favorite campground since.  My dad backed her trailer in and we went back to doing our own thing.

A few hours later she comes over and invites us over for dinner which was pork and beans.  She had an absolutely huge pot of beans and probably like a dozen hot dogs cut up into it which I remember being amused by considering she was just one little old lady but I guess she was hoping for some company.  We accepted even tho we already had eaten and hung out at her site with her for a while, she kinda just seemed like she wanted to talk to people and was sweet as can be.  I remember thinking she reminded me exactly of my grandmother who was your typical sweet old rural Alabama old lady.  

She ended up telling us about how she and her late husband had been going to this pretty out of the way campground for the last 40 years or something (since 1959 or some shit) and had a ton of stories about it etc.  The one I remember is her talking about a flash flood on the river (this campground was in a valley along a river) with some kid about my age probably 30 years previous fishing on the river and her husband basically running down and grabbing him up before the water got too high since the kid didn't realize the gravity of what was going on.  She said the flood came up the banks and wiped out all of the lower few sites along the river in a matter of like 10 minutes.

We probably spent an hour with this lady tops but it was just such a friendly and wholesome interaction that I still think about it in my mid 30s despite this probably being late 90s or so.  She came by a few more times to thank us again for helping her out with the trailer and stuff.  I like to think we made her weekend a little better because she really seemed like she needed some human interaction (judging thru my adult lens of what I was largely unconcerned with at the time as a 10 year old who mostly just wanted to go move rocks around in the river).

Bonus story: much more recently I was camped next to some old graybeard motorcycle dudes with choppers, an American flag on a pole they literally planted into the dirt in their campsite etc, Vietnam vets I think.  My brother and I were walking down to the creek to try to catch some trout, they yelled something like good luck as we walked past.  As luck would have it we pretty much immediately caught a decent trout big enough to eat so we were walking back with a good sized trout all of 20 mins later to cook up.  Dudes were so pumped about this (they were deep in drink at this point despite it being about 3 in the afternoon) they practically lobbed a few beers at our head so we brought them over some of the trout snack after we cooked it up on a plank by the fire

So I bought a massive cabin-tent for way more space to store my gear and my friend's gear in one of the partitions, and a Buddy Indoor-Safe propane heater to warm up the other partition for sleeping. **The problem is,** the entire roof of the tent is mesh, with only the rainfly about 6-8"" off the top of the tent.

He ended up giving me a substantial discount but asked me to pick it up from their warehouse, conveniently located nearby. Once I got back home, I wasted no time setting up the RTT. I then took my son on a two-day adventure to West Virginia to give it a test run. I must say, it exceeded my expectations overall.

Next up, I'm planning a solo camping trip for approximately a month. During this extended camping adventure, I realized that I might need to conduct some additional tests and preparations. I'm eager to learn what steps to take to ensure the RTT's reliability and my safety in this situation. I'm also contemplating whether I need to stock up on specific equipment or resources to handle various potential challenges.

Issue is, while I work I’ve noticed it makes my dog very happy. I want to get him a cot for camping. But I also want it to be light and packable. 

Only reason I wouldn’t buy a second one is price, at some point I can eat that cost but curious if anyone has a good packable dog cot that would fit for him coming to work with me and would also be used in our big tent.

I am from Ontario Canada and I grew up camping and so when I met my wife I was so excited that she wanted to get into camping as well. 

We have been tent camping (no back country yet) for the last 2 years and our bad trips have outweighed the good. 

Most recently this weekend we were in Arrowhead Provincial Park and 5mm of heavy rain absolutely flooded our tent. This has happened to us once before and both times we’ve had to pack up and leave early because our sites literally fill with water and the rain doesn’t stop. We are using the L.L Bean King Pine 4 that was handed down to us + the tent footprint. 

Is there any way to beat the rain? Or should we just expect to pack up when the weather is bad. 

TIA!",camping

Went through a painful breakup, lots of suicidal thoughts, drinking, working overtime, collapses due to exhaustion. The whole nine yards. However, I’ve decided to ditch the alcohol and fulfill a dream of mine. I want to start camping, just pack my things and leave for a weekend every now and then. Nothing but me and mother nature. I am however completely new to this so I wanted to get some tips on things that behinners maybe don’t think about when heading out on their own.

Here is a list of things I’ve bought so far. :
- Water ”container” (don’t know the right word) Total of 1L/0.2 Gallons (will need more than that FOR SURE)
- Storm kitchen
- Cooking supplies (pan, coffee pot, saucepan, cutlery)
- Knife
- First aid kit
- Tent (Might have to get a new one since mine is very basic, any advice on what to think about before I buy?)
- Sleeping bag suited for -7°C/19.4°F
- Fire gel (wrong name but a gel for starting fires easily)
- Just add water meals
- Headlamp
- Powerbank
- Backup batteries
- Lighter
-Compass

Is there anything else I’m missing except for the obviously horribly bad amount of water? Thanks in advance.

1678,1694930593.0,DIY 12v battery shower,"Hi all

I just finished making my own 12 volt completely portable battery powered shower.

It is made from the following parts:

- 20L plastic jerry can
- 12V camp shower kit
- a battery clip to suit Milwaukee 18V M18 battery
- an 18V to 12V DC converter
-12V push button switch
- some 3mm acrylic sheet bent into a gear tray
- neoprene adhesive sealant gasket tape

I cut a large hole in the top so the submersible pump would  fit in. Then I drilled some holes for the nylon compression glands to reticulate the shower hose and pump cable out of.

Next I cut & moulded the piece of acrylic which would act as a gear tray to mount the electrics, as well as a removable cover for the hole so that the pump can be removed for repair or replacement.

I mounted and wired up the switch, battery clip, and DC converter.

All new penetrations through the jerry can have been sealed with neoprene gasket material.

It is not 100% waterproof but it is waterproof enough that it won't spill water in your vehicle on a rough trail, as long as it stays right way up.

To use it, all you need to do is boil some water to add to the cold water inside, plug in a charged Milwaukee M18 battery onto the red clip, carry to where you want to use it, and press the button to operate the pump.

I also have a drop down table on my Jeep tailgate so I leave the jerry can in the rear of the Jeep and use it for washing dishes etc after cooking.

Over the course of 15 years of camping, cycling, hiking and being outdoors most of the time. I have yet to encounter a blow up sleeping pad that has not, at some point, failed. I do not even recall the names of these sleeping pads at this juncture.

As I lay, on yet another dying pad, I think to myself. Gee, I might be getting up there in the high end price range where maybe it's worth investing in a quality grade sleeping mat. However, I am still of the opinion, and I think of this in many respects of my life, IT WILL BREAK. No matter what. 

Has anyone ever made it through more than, sheesh, idk, 2 years with the same sleeping pad? With no holes? And using it regularly?

I'm actually going on a YEAR with a PowerLux Dumb Pad, and it was the longest running one I've ever had. However, after starting a bicycle trip; I'm two months into a trip from Nordkapp, Norway to Cape Town, South Africa, I have yet another casualty of the open road.

1733,1694728297.0,How to still enjoy camping when the isolation and silence is gone?,"Hello, everyone.

I'm a long time camper, hiker and general outdoorsy person. Part of what I used to enjoy the most about the outdoors was just getting away from people and noise. I am fairly introverted person, so I just feel like I need to get away from people, noise and busy city life in order to recharge myself. Unfortunately, that is just rarely the case anymore. It just seems every year that outdoors hobbies, especially camping, just keep increasing in popularity. I started noticing the popularity increase a bit before COVID and it just sky rocketed after COVID, at least where I like to go (west Texas, east and north New Mexico and all over Arizona). Having read similar stories here and other subs, I know I'm not the only one experiencing this.

Anyway, in an effort to experience quiet and isolation again, I have been trying to get more and more remote and off trail. It is definitely better, but I still encounter people and often obnoxious ones (from my view point anyway). For example, I tried to take up dispersed camping recently, which is less crowded for sure, but it's not an escape. The last night of my most recent dispersed camp, a couple of dudes should up at like 9 pm and were making tons of noise setting up while talking and laughing loudly. While not ideal, I can overlook that. Unfortunately, they started playing extremely loud music (like small concert loud) at 10:30 pm. From what I have been reading on this sub lately, it seems like a lot of people are experiencing similar or worse including theft and threatening behavior while dispersed camping.

So, long story short, I have accepted that I can't escape people or noise anymore. That's just the current reality. However, I would still like to enjoy the outdoors. My question for all the other campers out there is have you found a way to to still enjoy camping without the quiet and isolation? This question is specifically for people who enjoy the isolated and quiet aspect of camping. I get noise and people don't bother many of you. For those who like the quiet, how have you continued to enjoy the outdoors with the quiet gone (if it has gone away like it has for me)?

Edit: Going more remote hasn't helped as I mentioned, so that's why I'm asking how people still have fun camping when it's not quiet. I have accepted people will always be present

Edit 2: I'm not complaining. I fully understand we ""share"" the outdoors with other people. I have never asked anyone I have encountered to leave, to keep quiet or been rude to them in any way. Like I said, I have accepted people will always be around. I want to continue enjoying the outdoors despite that.

Edit 3: Once again, I have gone dispersed camping and tried going more remote. People still show up. Not to mention seedy activity goes on at dispersed campsites as others have mentioned. The southwest US seems to have become very popular. Why? I don't know. I guess the southwest is hot right now (no pun intended). Anyway, that's why I am not asking how to find more quiet, just how to still enjoy the outdoors with people present. Regardless, thanks for all the helpful ideas. Backpacking is definitely a consideration of mine but it is time consuming, and I don't have a lot of gear and can't afford to buy a lot of gear. Still willing to try it out if I can get my wife onboard. Weekday camping is also definitely a consideration but both my wife and I work day jobs and we don't get a ton of leave time. It's hard for us just to take a week off and disappear. If we can though, I'm sure we will find more peace and quiet. I will also try checking out other states like Utah, Nevada, California etc. Again, getting the time off is an issue though. I will also give Hicamp a look.

I had towels out to dry so clearly I was coming back - at least this time they left my chair?

They spent about $150 in wood (and had already brought a trunk full) and when I asked why they told me that’s what people do when they go camping. Does anyone else do this? The only time it went out was when we were sleeping and even then I woke up to it being back on.

1753,1694704892.0,Can you help us grasp how windspeed (~15mph) translates to force on tents and canopies?,"We’re heading to a festival in Mass this weekend, about 80 miles east of Boston. Weather Underground is predicting 10 – 16 mph winds but no rain.  I've never really looked at wind speeds in isolation, so I don't have a concept of how numbers translate to lived experience.   

We have a basic 6-person Coleman tent and a 13' pop-up. 

The tent gets staked down at all points and has done us well thus far in a few heavyish storm, but again I have nothing to compare it to (i.e. was that “wow, that was windy!” a 5 mph or 15 mph situation?). 

The pop-up takes two stakes per leg. In rainstorms, we pull the corner canopy extensions (the short poles that expand the canopy from 10' to 13') and drop the legs down so it's about four feet off the grown rather than fully up. 

None of that protects from other canopies or tents that have taken flight, of course. 

Are 15 mph winds likely to wreak havoc across the festival? A few lost tents and whatnot here and there but generally just very gusty? 

We usually stake so the stake angle is either opposite the rope it's holding (i.e. so it forms an acute angle between the rope and the ground) and in two different angles in each pop-up leg. Any advice on improving that? 

Lastly, since we're going to be staking the heck out of things, any advice on how to get those straight stakes (the ones with a slightly larger top, not with a hook to it) out of the ground when it's time to go? They're usually difficult, but I imagine over-securing things is likely to make it a nightmare to pull them up, especially those that are flush with the metal legs of the pop-up.

Am new to this subreddit but have been camping for years across the US. Am curious to know if anyone has had a similar experience, or advice for something that happened last weekend. 

Basically, I was camping in a state park (a full state park, families and other campers all around) by myself, as a female. I woke up at 330 AM Saturday night/Sunday morning to find the lone male camping next door to me walking next to my tent and staring down at me. I freaked out, and left. 

No matter how long I try to steel man his behavior, I just can't come up with a reason why he would: 

1. be on my campsite at all, at 330 am no less. our sites are large and would not be incidental that he'd traversed from his site to mine

2. be where he was standing, which is directly next to my tent in the least reasonable place to be standing (just a sliver of space between tent and picnic bench, but closest space to my head) if he was genuinely just trying to walk across my site 

3. looking down into my tent watching me, as i was sleeping

I left the campsite immediately, in the middle of the night, and notified the park. Any thoughts or advice?

1774,1694628305.0,New to camping. Just sayin’ hi.,"
Hey all, new to camping but me and my partner are really looking forward to getting into it. I bought a Basecamp 6 tent from REI (half price, baby!) and I’m slowly sourcing gear. My goal is to go camping next (late) spring for the first time. We live in Rhode Island so I’m thinking our maiden trip will be in New England. 

For our first few trips, we’d like to car camp on a campground. That way, we can work out the kinks and figure out what we need and what we don’t need. Our preference would be for camp sites that are somewhat isolated from each other, but with access to bathrooms/showers. 

I have heard of a few campgrounds that only allow tents. There’s something I like about that. We don’t have kids so playground amenities or “entertainment” really isn’t exciting to us. We’re going to have some peace and quiet, with a few comforts and luxuries.  

After that, we’d like to really see what is out there for camping. I think we’d both like to see a mixture of different camping experiences like backpack camping, disperse camping, and hot tent camping. 

So far I’ve been bringing myself up to speed by watching YouTube videos on different things to keep in mind, types of gear, etc. and though I really like watching, I am going to have a ton of questions. That’s why I want to say hi to all you awesome people. 😀",camping

The bugs currently are a pain during the day, but at dusk they seem to chill out, but I don't know if they will start bugging (excuse the pun) us after we stop moving, and not sure if bug spray alone will do the trick.

1788,1694623246.0,Walking through your camp,"TLDR: guy walks through my campsite to fish and says I'm the asshole when I tell him it is rude.

I want to check to see if I was rude in this situation.   The other day I was at a BLM campsite.  This spot has 4 camp sites, they are quite obvious from a fireplace and stone picnic table.  Since this location is by a river two of the camp spots have little paths people have picked through to get to the water.  One path is roughly 10-15 feet long and the other is about 35ft long.  There is also a boat ramp with extra parking right by the bathroom.

I got there super early and picked one of the camp spots with water access.  It was the edge of a hill, the picnic table, about 3 ft from that the firepit, then 4 ft from that my truck bed.  So i was in the spot and relatively compaxt.  I was in camp putting a few things in the truck about to walk the dog when all of a sudden a big yellow lab comes walking into my camp.  Right after that a guy comes up and goes we are just going to the fishing spot.  He walks right past me, between the fire pit and my truck, then to the path that leads to the water.  I was kind of dumbstruck but still took my dog on a walk.  A minute later I saw his friend and asked to confirm.   I told him it was quite rude to walk through a camp spot to fish.  He said they would watch out but then when I got to camp it was obvious he had went through it to go meet his buddy.

A little later the original guy came through and basically said I was wrong for saying it was rude.  I told him he can't just walk through a camp site, one that is at a designated spot, when somebody is there.  I told him it was extremely rude and asked what if my dog was the aggressive type?  He tried to say he was a local so that's what they do but I don't quite believe that part.  He also hinted that if he didnt have his 2 year old strapped to his chest there would be a fight.  I've camped around the country and never had somebody do this.

To add one more piece of information, his friend didn't come back through my camp.  There was a larger, recreation area 125 yards down the road.  In the river they were literally closer to the water access at that recreation area and not the camping area so his friend exited that way.

So basically, am I an asshole or am I right in thinking that guy was full of shit and rude for doing that?",camping

I set it up in my yard. I put down a cheap ground tarp and set the tent up on top of it - then sprayed it down with a hose to check if it was leaky or needed some waterproofing / resealing. The fly seemed to be waterproof - but there was some pooling coming from the floor. I don't know a lot about tents; can this be solved by 're water proofing' this or have I wasted my money?

Since the tarp extended beyond the fly, the water was caught and 'pooled up' directly under the tent, which may have been part of the reason - but I would figure the base of most tents should be able to hold up to something like that, no?

Is there another test I can try? I just want to make sure I don't wake up soaked if it rains while I'm using this tent :)

1801,1694548719.0,Coleman Carlsbad review,"
I purchased the Coleman Carlsbad 4 person tent for use camping at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival this past weekend. For those who don't know, it ended up a shit show, one of the major problems being a massive out of nowhere spinoff storm that did a ton of damage to tents cars and canopies. 

I initially bought this tent because I liked the screened in porch, and I figured the darkroom technology would be useful in case we wanted to sleep in a little bit after long nights without the sun shining in our faces. That feature did turn out to be the second best aspect of the tent - not because of the sun, but because we ended up being camped directly underneath one of those massive generator lights. It was like camping beneath a mini sun, but yet when we crawled into bed each night, you'd never know the blazing glow of the only thing that worked at that festival was there. 

The best feature was by far the waterproofing. If you've seen some reviews saying the screened in area is not at all waterproof, those complaints are definitely true. It could use some additional setup to help keep some of the water out, but it was perfect for leaving our already wet clothes, and honestly having a slight second layer of security to the tent opening setup. Beyond the porch layer of the tent though, the waterproofing was phenomenal. Neighbors all around us were blowing out of the ground and flooding and some were literally flying through the air, but not the Coleman Carlsbad. We stayed dry, even *with the windows open* at times. We didn't even have a tarp layer down under the tent.

Additional perks: the pockets on the back side were super handy and nicely sized for storing everything from water bottles and charging phones to medications, and the top hook was perfect to add a light and fan for the heat. We didn't end up using the screened in area (see: rain and also 7' tall friend who wouldn't fit) but it would have been great if there were bugs and better weather. My husband did end up taking a nap in there on one of the drier days lol. 

Cons: I really don't have a lot of complaints, but one thing I will say is the entrance to the screened in area definitely needs a way to be staked down in the middle, because otherwise you need two hands to get out and idk about y'all but I don't have the brain power to use both hands at 7am.

Recommendations: I would definitely recommend a tarp under the tent and an additional rain fly setup for the screened in area if you're anticipating wet weather and want that part to be dry. I would also recommend heavier duty tent stakes - while the majority of the stakes we used held up to the rain and wind of the storms (only one came out and it probably wasn't in right), a number of them bent as we tried to stake the tent down (which is probably why the one wasn't in right), so honestly we're definitely springing for something larger and stronger next time.

Overall, 9.5/10 for the Coleman Carlsbad, I may never buy another tent again",camping

I don’t want to spend more than $500 and would love if there is an option less than that. Honestly in my uneducated opinion a Coleman tent would work good but there’s so many options.

Now, state parks aren't necessarily known for being quiet, but we've had pretty good luck at this one over the years. It's past peak season and the weather forecast called for rain all weekend so we expected at least some peace & quiet. 

Lucky for us almost the entire trail was empty save for an older couple across the creek and a group of about 6-8 people in their 20's a couple sites down. I expected the group would get a little rowdy, but what I wasn't expecting was for them to unload and ENTIRE DRUM SET and bang on them all day and into the night. Thankfully they wrapped it up before we went to bed, but they started back at it at 9 am! 

We still had a great time despite being forced to attend a concert we didn't want tickets to...But, I'm just dumbfounded how anyone in their right mind would think bringing a drum set camping is anything but insanely disrespectful.

1820,1694445429.0,Is Camping in the garden weird ?,"I used to live in a different country where they were a lot of national parks and small campsites. You could choose between ones with showers and toilets and kids clubs to the most basic campsites which just had a long drop toilet. No water, no flushing toilet, no nothing. 

I've gone camping by myself once and found it kinda fun. Slightly lonely but overall really enjoyed it. 

I've since moved country and now the only campsite I can find have all the bells and whistles. 
Even the basic campsites in this country have kids clubs, toilets and shower blocks. 
Not what I wanted at all. 

If I just set up my tent in the garden and sleep in that for a few nights. As a single adult. Does that come across as sort of pathetic? 

With a house right there etc. 

But I kinda liked the whole sleeping in the tent, curled up in my sleeping bag, cooking my food on my little heater etc 

But at the other campsite I went hiking around the woods and relaxing by the tent etc. 

Is it a little pathetic to just be sat in my garden reading a book ? 

I would like to try and find friends to go camping with but again I like the basic camping , take everything with you because there are barely anything supplied for you kinda camping. 

There was a fire pit at the campsite and I loved sitting around it during the afternoon and evening but I can't light a fire pit in my garden. So I think I'll just be sat there bored or reading or watching things on Netflix or something because there is nothing else to do.

1828,1694384148.0,Obnoxious campers in Shenandoah,"After 30+ years in a tent, last night was definitely one of my least enjoyable nights. We were in Shenandoah and the group next to us had 4 cars parked on a spot. (Two on the grass.) A ranger came by and told them to move two cars and buy another spot. They did, but only parked the cars there and set up tents in the same camp. Long story short, at about 12 am they started drunkenly screaming and slamming car doors until 430 a.m. The campground hosts did nothing. Finally, at 430, the surrounding tents starting yelling, shut the \*\*\*\* up, in near unison and they went to bed. However, instead of going to tents they got into their Teslas and left them running for a few hours.

A few surrounding campers said they had repeatedly asked the group to be quiet throughout the night to no avail.

After we broke camp, my wife and I walked over to group and I kindly explained how disrespectful they had been to the entire campground. They were speaking in Chinese, but definitely knew English (talking to me and ranger). I said after years of camping I had never experienced such a disrespectful group and they come back to be more considerate to others in the site. The guy said whatever and walked away so I simply said I will let the ranger station on the way out in hopes they would issue a fine. He said, ""Go ahead"", so I did. Not only where they loud, but they also did not follow bear procedures. They ruined at least a dozen campers night and its not insignificant getting into Shenandoah sites (30 to reserve; 20 to enter or use a park pass).

Thankfully, another couple complained at the ranger station at the same time and they said they would send a ranger to the site. I think a fine is the only way future campers might have a better experience next to this group.

1858,1694370144.0,Rushed Camping Trip Now? Or Better Planned Next Year?,"It's a fine line between ""spontaneous"" and ""rushed"" I guess. I was thinking about a solo road trip with my dog to go camping up North. I mentioned this to a friend and he offered to let me camp on a piece of property he owns near the Canadian border. He showed it to me once, it's a beautiful spot directly on the water surround by trees on the other three sides, with a picnic table, an eco-friendly outhouse, a small rowboat and then nothing else but the Loons, it's a great spot.

But I got sidetracked with a few important projects at home and time is getting away from me. He emailed today to say he bought camp wood to leave on the property for me, but that if I'm going I should not delay because it'll be too cold soon. Or that I should go next summer. I guess I forgot how much colder it can be up North, especially on the water. It's not really a matter of gear, I have all-season gear, but I don't like cold weather camping and neither does my Senior dog. I want to do it when it's warmer; so it's right now or next year. 

I'd have to set aside projects, throw my tent and some gear in the vehicle and go without much planning, which is hard for me because I'm a 'planner'. I was going to travel through two states and make a scenic road trip out of it, not just the camping itself. Any thoughts on going somewhat rushed vs. planning it out but waiting until next year? I don't get away often, so this was a big deal for me.",camping

We plan to camp probably 70% of the time. We have 3 kids, a Toyota Sienna, and while I’ve camped in bear country before, I’ve only gone backpacking and haven’t experienced car camping where bears are. My biggest concern right now is what to do about food and I want PLENTY of time to figure that out and source what we need. Since we’ll only be staying places 1-2 nights (maybe 3), I want to be as efficient with our setup as safely as we possibly can.

We are thinking of getting a 4x4 or 4x5 trailer and there’s plenty of time to make it however we want. We’ll be camping in some national (Tetons, Yellowstone, Glacier, etc), state, and provincial parks. How should I store my food in a way that bears won’t be motivated to get to it, that follow park rules, AND don’t involve a ton of extra labor every single time we stop at a new place? I know you aren’t supposed to leave coolers where bears can see it, but is covering an IGBC certified bear-resistant and secured cooler on a trailer enough? How should I store utensils, cookware, dishes? Dry goods? Should I be worried about my kids eating snacks in the car during the day? 

I’ve spent a ton of time googling looking for solutions and all I’ve really gotten out of it is feeling more stressed and confused. Any advice to make this easier is super appreciated.",camping

Please don't go tent camping with your newborn.,"I'm probably going to be downvoted into oblivion, but I feel so frustrated when I go camping and have to listen to someone else's baby wailing all night. I came to the wilderness to  be in nature, to be soothed to sleep by the sound of insects, night birds, and armadillos checking out the trash bag at the campsite next to mine.

&#x200B;

Last time I went camping I had to listen to a newborn baby screaming his displeasure for several *hours*, two nights in a row. It kept me up and made it more difficult for me to get up early the next mornings.

&#x200B;

I have to save my vacation time very carefully for these trips. I go twice a year and they are the highlight of my broke millennial life. I just feel like it's rude to bring such a small child to a place where other people's sleep can be disturbed.

&#x200B;

Yes, I could choose hike-ins, but I shouldn't *have* to. If someone else went to a public campsite and started an all-night freestyle rap competition without notifying the other guests, everyone would agree that's not cool.",camping

The night after he received a concussion he disappeared from his home in the middle of the night. His shoes were found near the river and there were concerns that he had drowned. However, there has been both an aerial and diver search with no results. The family has reason to believe that he continued hiking or decided to hitchhike away from the area.

It's not very well-known. That's why we like it, though. We come here often. We're currently staying with our two very young kids. My husband and I are the only adults. We also have our dog. 

Earlier this evening we had an odd experience where a truck with a man and woman stopped by our camp site. They asked if we'd stayed at this particular campground before, and we said we had. They said that we need to be careful, because it's not safe here. We said that we'd been coming here for a few years and never felt unsafe. They went on to say that there's no cell service and no way to call for help (usually that's true,  but for some reason tonight we do have service). They said there's a lot of drugs.

They drove off and the only other camper here also left. There are two vacant tents near us and a vacant camper on the other end of the campground. There are no other cars. It seems we are 100% alone here tonight. 

My husband thinks we'll be fine. The conversation left me with a bad gut feeling, though. I feel very uneasy- especially because we have our kids. 

What would you do in this situation?

UPDATE: We're ALIVE! We took our kids home and came back out ourselves. The guy who warned us proceeded to sit and fish most of the night. I'm guessing he was upset someone was sharing his ""good spot"".",camping
