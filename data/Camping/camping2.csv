1,1695942949.0,Finally Had First Unsafe Outdoors Experience,"Hey campers!

So...it finally happened. Bummer. 

I (usually a tent camper) rented an a-frame for a small, female-only family trip. Two female adults, two female kid/teens. 

I woke up at 3 am to hear what I think was footsteps outside our a-frame. Gahhhhh. I couldn't see out, but the possible intruder could see in because three sides of the a-frame were made of corrugated plastic. 

I was really scared, especially because I had my two beloved nieces and sister in there with me. 

I stayed inside and kept covered up, in hopes that the intruder would not be able to tell the gender or age of the people inside. 

I didn't pick up my cell to call for help,because I didn't want my face to be illuminated or my female voice to be heard. I also didn't have a way to give emergency responders directions to the a-frame since it was accessed via a path in the woods. 

I stayed awake and tried to breathe calmly, reminding myself that the sun would eventually be up and that MOST people do not get killed or attacked when camping. I also reminded myself that the person had not yet seen fit to attempt entering the structure. 

I'm not SURE it was a person out there. It was raining very hard, which sort of obscured the sound, but it really did sound like a human in hiking boots taking a few steps, pausing a while, and continuing to explore the site. This continued for 3.5 hours. 

We had no items of value, so nothing was taken. 

The a-frame was in the back of the owner's farm, so it wasn't another camper at a neighboring site. 

I mentioned this to the owner, and she didn't explain it away as an animal or anything, like ""Oh there are tons of deer. They walk around at night."" She did say she would look around for footprints and that the day after we left, they found a dead/attacked duck on the property. 

I felt so oddly defenseless in there. Any other campers experience this? I would love any safety tips or insight. I

I'll definitely force myself to stay outside again SOON, but I'm definitely open to any tips on how I could have been better prepared to handle this, especially as a female camper. 

Thanks, fellow campers!",camping

I could walk into an REI anywhere in the country and get a zipper repaired, a tear patched, etc. Always for free and without waiting. I always considered this the ""free oil change"" of outdoor gear, with how much I spend there every year.

It's probably not news to anyone here, but at some point in the past few years they have abandoned their warranty. No more lifetime support. I tried today to get a zipper repair on a (fairly expensive) REI down jacket that had a YKK fail. They now consider this ""wear & tear"". No grandfathering for products bought under a better warranty. In any case, salad days are over, and all my old REI gear will need replacement when it breaks.

I've heard good things about North Face. Have a friend with two free zipper repairs on a 15 year old bag. Any other recommendations? I'll pay more for the level of support REI used to have. I'd like to know that when I'm in a bind 5 years from now, the manufacturer will be in business, and I'd like retail locations. When you're packing for a trip and notice a failed zipper, mailing your gear away won't help.

edit: Please, on topic posts only. I'm looking for gear manufacturers who offer lifetime repair support. Zippers are not the topic‚ÄîI also use stoves, hammocks, therma-rests, knives, etc. REI manufactured their own versions of all these products.

Couple things to note: 

We are not going to a designated campground, but to an area my family frequents for camping. The bears in the area will not be used to human interaction.

We will be tenting.

We have bear boxes for trash and food, so the used hygiene products will hopefully not cause issues. I'm more worried about her person.

19,1694623246.0,Walking through your camp,"TLDR: guy walks through my campsite to fish and says I'm the asshole when I tell him it is rude.

I want to check to see if I was rude in this situation.   The other day I was at a BLM campsite.  This spot has 4 camp sites, they are quite obvious from a fireplace and stone picnic table.  Since this location is by a river two of the camp spots have little paths people have picked through to get to the water.  One path is roughly 10-15 feet long and the other is about 35ft long.  There is also a boat ramp with extra parking right by the bathroom.

I got there super early and picked one of the camp spots with water access.  It was the edge of a hill, the picnic table, about 3 ft from that the firepit, then 4 ft from that my truck bed.  So i was in the spot and relatively compaxt.  I was in camp putting a few things in the truck about to walk the dog when all of a sudden a big yellow lab comes walking into my camp.  Right after that a guy comes up and goes we are just going to the fishing spot.  He walks right past me, between the fire pit and my truck, then to the path that leads to the water.  I was kind of dumbstruck but still took my dog on a walk.  A minute later I saw his friend and asked to confirm.   I told him it was quite rude to walk through a camp spot to fish.  He said they would watch out but then when I got to camp it was obvious he had went through it to go meet his buddy.

A little later the original guy came through and basically said I was wrong for saying it was rude.  I told him he can't just walk through a camp site, one that is at a designated spot, when somebody is there.  I told him it was extremely rude and asked what if my dog was the aggressive type?  He tried to say he was a local so that's what they do but I don't quite believe that part.  He also hinted that if he didnt have his 2 year old strapped to his chest there would be a fight.  I've camped around the country and never had somebody do this.

To add one more piece of information, his friend didn't come back through my camp.  There was a larger, recreation area 125 yards down the road.  In the river they were literally closer to the water access at that recreation area and not the camping area so his friend exited that way.

So basically, am I an asshole or am I right in thinking that guy was full of shit and rude for doing that?",camping

A family rolls up in two vehicles, and bursts from them yelling, screaming, running, etc.  Not just the kids  but the parents  who are trying to yell over their kids acting like their buddies instead of their parents.

25,1670199324.0,Question about babies and camping,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for thoughts and opinions from campers with and without children so I can have a better understanding of camping culture and how to manage my expectations properly.

I just got back from a camping trip with my fiance where we reserved a hike-in spot that was 2 miles in from the trailhead. At the trailhead there was a huge campsite that was super family friendly with playgrounds and lots of facilities for kiddos of any age. We personally wanted to have a quieter experience where we were surrounded by more nature sounds than people sounds, so that's why we chose the hike-in.

For both nights that we camped at our site, the family camping at the nearest site to us (~50 ft away?) had a little baby who clearly was not enjoying their stay, and they cried and screamed at the top of their lungs every hour for the entirety of both nights. My fiance and I were exhausted (as I'm sure the parents were too) and obviously frustrated at the lack of sleep. I also felt that the parents were being quite disrespectful towards the other hike-in campers by both bringing a baby out to a hike-in spot when there were facilities available at the campsite near the trailhead to make it easy to calm the baby if they started to be loud (restrooms or your car nearby to take the baby in) and also for continuing to stay out there after the baby already cried through the first night.

I get that babies cry and I don't think the parents shouldn't be able to camp just because they have a little one, but I was under the impression that if you wanted a quieter camp you booked hike-in spots and if you were camping at a typical car-camping/family friendly you should expect noise (or know that those types of camping spots might be more appropriate if you feel like you will make a fair amount of noise).

I'm aware that it's possible I've just been lucky to have never had noisy neighbors at any hike-in spots and/or that I could be overreacting out of exhaustion. But I'm also curious because, with any posts I've seen on this sub in the past complaining about noise from others (babies included), the solution proposed is that said complainer should've chosen a hike-in spot, which we did. What are all of your thoughts about this?",camping

Two weeks in a tent in the Florida Keys in October. Hot (95+ degrees) and very humid. My wife and I are at a camp site with her parents, our 9 year old daughter who is nonverbal autistic & 18 month old son.

My wife's family used to camp regularly, but I do not. Her parents and my daughter are in an RV, with my wife, son, and I in a tent that we discovered leaks.

I'm constantly covered in a glaze of my own sweat and being eaten alive by mosquitoes and noseeums. I *want* to like camping, but this is pure misery. My mood is making me miserable to be around and I feel like I'm ruining it for everyone.

General or specific advice on what I can do to make a better experience for myself (and by extension, my family).

UPDATE:: We're leaving in two days, though I'm pushing hard to leave tomorrow. It's a two day drive. Also, it rained its ass off last night and we do not appear to have any leaks.

Burn the burnables, collect the non-burnables for the landfills, etc. my question is in regards to what all you would dispose of by burning in your campfire? Paper products are obvious. But what about plastics, paper/plastic hybrids, etc? Is burning those a grievous sin as well? I understand chemical by-products released from burning things such as plastic outside of the proper facilities, but is my one weekend of camping really affecting things?

Edit: I appreciate the replies, even the ones that come off as condescending. To clarify a couple of things:

I was raised in the woods far removed from civilization. I have a healthy respect for nature and preserving it. The fact that I‚Äôm asking the question and wanting to improve my understanding/practices should somewhat reflect that. 

The camping I‚Äôm referring to is at a public campground in the center of my city. It has a dedicated fire pit. It‚Äôs not backcountry or very remote. I can drive my car 3 minutes and be in the nearest neighborhood. I‚Äôm not trying to diminish the importance of LNT, but the footprint of humanity is here regardless of my participation in good/bad practices. 

I agree with anyone who says the mentality of ‚Äúwhat I do doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù is a bad state of mind. However, I am a realist at heart and believe that until we fix the pollution caused by large corporations, whether or not we individually dedicate our lives to green living doesn‚Äôt matter and the 1% are going to cause more environmental damage than we ever could.",camping

I mean the odd person might bring a rifle for target practice but majority of Canadians who go back woods hiking/camping do not bring guns.   We just kinda deal with animal encounters as one would expect any sane person to do... be aware of your surroundings. Remember most animals are more scared of you than you of them. Make yourself appear bigger and stronger. And make plenty of noise so you don't surprise any.  For example when I'm out in my tent and worried a bear is poking around well its time for 99 bottles of beer on the wall nice and loud (which honestly is enough to scare away just about anything lol) Bear Mace is cool but I've never actually brought any since it's relatively new and I never used it when I was young doing the exact same thing... so I dunno.... maybe Canadians are super bad ass when it comes to camping in the back country by themselves,camping

96,1608045754.0,Are Rooftop Tents Worth It?,"Today most people employ a ground tent set up when camping. They are compact, easy to carry, and provide protection from the elements.

With the invention of the roof top tent, another mode of camping has arisen. As the off-road community grows and more people choose to camp in the backcountry in their 4x4 vehicles, rooftop tents have become increasingly popular.

This guide is meant to help you consider the pros and cons of each option and determine whether it is worth it to buy a rooftop tent.

## Ground Tent

Pros:

* Compact and easy to transport
* Lower cost
* More stable in wind
* Traditional camping feel

Cons:

* More work to set up
* Exposed to ground critters

## Rooftop Tent

Pros:

* Quickly deployable
* Always attached to your car
* Security sleeping above the ground

Cons:

* Expensive $$$
* Takes up a lot of space

## Conclusion

It is important to choose the right tent for your specific needs, which can vary based on where you live, your vehicle, and what type of overlanding you do.

For those who need to park their car in a garage, the rooftop tent may cause issues with height clearance. Additionally, if you need more space for gear on your trips a rooftop tent may take up too much space and you may want to opt for the ground tent.

For some it may be worth dropping the extra $$$ on a rooftop tent. If you spend a lot of time camping and move spots often, it can be easy to have the rooftop tent ready for action along the way. Additionally, you may feel more secure camping on the roof opposed to the ground

A rooftop tent is a big investment, so consider your needs and how well the rooftop tent fits those needs. Consider the benefits as well as the drawbacks before jumping into the purchase.

BUT, my body is too high maintance for camping.

(1) I can't sleep in sleeping bags, I feel trapped, especially my legs, cuz at home i sleep in X shape....

(2) Sleep temperature is REALLY important for me. I can't do anything that isn't between 67 to 74F, and dry.

(3) After I use the restroom i have to wash and soak my rear in a basin of hot water because i have hemorrhoid. I tried the wet wipes, doesn't work, hurt as hell, and it will keep hurting until i soak it.

What should i do? I even tried ""Glamping"", still couldn't sleep cuz that wooden stove thing keeps getting too hot and too cold, the whole night i was waking up to put more wood or closing the vent to make the fire smaller. So I would go camping during the summer, but i will not get any rest, but i still like it, i just can't do it for more than 2 nights cuz i need to check into a hotel to sleep. ",camping

Even a small pistol. Sure, it‚Äôs highly unlikely to kill a bear, or a charging mountain lion with a pistol, but there‚Äôs a high chance you can scare it off by firing a few rounds in the air. 

A lot of those horror stories of campers/hikers getting mauled by an animal could have possibly been avoided.

150,1395089312.0,My worst night of camping: Teenagers on the run and getting firecrackers shot at me.,"Every year in the Spring, my boy scout troop goes to this awesome military base for a camping trip. It's not like normal camping trips where we hike or something: We do swimming, golfing, ping pong, and all sorts of awesome stuff. It's consistently one of the best weekends of the year. Most years, despite the awesomeness *something* goes wrong, as they generally do on camping trips. One year I forgot to bring money, another I got really sick... But this one takes the cake.

It was the last night of our trip, and our troop decided to play a big game of capture the flag. And I mean **BIG.** It went from a field behind our campsite, the other team's base, through a fairly large forest, past an arcade, and across a big field to a baseball field which was our area. The game went pretty slow, considering our troop is rather small, but it was really fun. About an hour in (it was close to pitch black at this point) while I was playing defense, I saw the entire other team and some of ours running to us. While I was thinking *""I'm gonna have to play some really good defense,""* they started yelling at me and another guy who was playing defense to come over. I remember thinking something like *""Do they think I'm stupid?""* But after some more yelling we walked over.

Turns out that some teenager ran away and was on the run from the cops right around us. Also, the police description of them sounded exactly like me (not relevant, but I was scared shitless). We walked back to the campsite, and we were the only ones out. When we were exactly one campsite over from ours, all hell broke loose. There was suddenly a group of teenagers a few yards away from us, yelling and cussing. Then I see some sort of bright red thing being shot at us from them. I didn't think *""The hell? Is this related to the guy on the run from the cops?""* I didn't think *""What's even happening right now?""* I just thought ***""HOLY FUCK THERE ARE FIRECRACKERS BEING SHOT AT US, RUN!""*** They probably would only have given us minor injuries had they hit us, but it was the scariest, most adrenaline filled moment of my life so I just booked it. Fast forward to when we are back at the campsite, me and another guy are walking to the tents about to go and sleep and he says something to sum it up perfectly.

""I'm fucking done with this camping trip.""

I have no idea if the guy on the run had anything to do with the firecrackers, or why they shot them at us (probably just assholes screwing around). There was also a guy that came to our campsite telling a pretty badass story of how he caught the guy a bit later, but at that point I didn't care. I just wanted to leave.",camping

I recently bought a vacuum sealer machine and I am looking ideas on foods that don't require dehydrating and will last up to two weeks or more without refrigeration. A friend has been vacuum packing tortillas for me for years, but I know there are more applications than flat breads.

I am a Scout leader and I am often called upon to share my outdoor cooking knowledge with the youth. This means I have to address dietary restrictions (medical, religious, and personal decisions) to encourage the kids to plan menus that are inclusive to all the members of their unit. Bonus points for you if you can provide ideas for gluten free, allergen free, and/or vegan/vegetarian.

I am in Wisconsin so bonus points will be awarded for cheese ideas.

I did wake up feeling a bit chilly at times. Overall, on my feet (because they were against the door of my small tent that is cheap and just one layer) and on my back (cold coming from the ground).

The problem with the bag is that it doesn't really close all the way at the neck/shoulders, so that air can come in from the top. I use my liner try to prevent that (and I can put it over my head as a cap to keep warmer), but there's most likely still air coming in that I can't prevent. So I'm going to test if other cheap bags can close up at the top so that no air can get in. If not I'm sticking with this cheap bag.

Now I was wondering if buying [5 euro fleece blanket](http://imgur.com/a/io4Z1) will help? I also got this super thin blanket I got for free on an airplane, but I'm thinking that might not do much and fleece will.

Also since my matras clealy doesn't completely keep the cold from  the ground away, I was thinking of buying a cheap 5 euro[ silver reflective pad](http://imgur.com/a/eHMxo). It's like the camping pads/yoga mats with silver reflective stuff, but without the cushion and just a pretty thin layer (positive: it doesn't take up much space). Would that keep the cold from the ground away better?

I was also considering buying [a better tent](http://nl.decathlon.be/arpenaz-2-id_8347889.html) that's bigger so my feet don't touch it. And one that has two layers. This will probably be warmer, and also better to stop condensation on the inside of the inner layer. (it probably also has better ventilation, not sure though)

**TL;DR** 

- Is a [5 euro fleece blanket](http://imgur.com/a/io4Z1) over my sleeping bag going to keep me warmer/worth buying (and prevent air from coming in the bag at the neck/shoulders)?

- Is a [silver/aluminium reflective coating pad](http://imgur.com/a/eHMxo) (without the thick cushion) on top of a self inflated pad going to keep me warmer from the ground or is the silver pad not going to do much?

184,1454003249.0,RV Extended Warranties,"Extended warranties of any kind are not well thought of and, often, that's for good reason. Stories abound about warranty companies not paying claims and seemingly going out of their way not to pay.

In addition, they are often expensive and when they don't provide the expected coverage, frustration levels shoot through the roof.

In general, I'm not a big fan of extended warranties, but they can have value if we understand their purpose, we have the right expectations, and we don't have to pay too much.

We've had very good experiences with the extended warranties on our fifth wheel, and we've been kicking ourselves for not having one on our truck when we lost the engine. For the right price and coverage, they can make a lot of sense on RVs, cars, trucks, SUVs, boats, motorcycles, ATVs, snowmobiles, and personal watercraft.

So we're going to explore the pros and cons and try to provide tips on how to get the most out of an extended warranty.

Extended Warranty Basics

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a ""warranty"" as:

""a usually written guarantee of the integrity of a product and of the maker's responsibility for the repair or replacement of defective parts"".

That's a fairly standard definition and implies a ""warranty"" is something issued by the manufacturer of a product AND it is included in the price of the product.

What we are talking about here are technically ""service contracts"". The purpose is basically the same as a warranty, but it may or may not be issued by the manufacturer, it provides coverage for an extended period beyond the manufacturer's warranty, and, of course, there is an additional fee or ""premium"".

However, for our purposes here, we will use the terms ""extended warranty"" and ""extended service contract"" interchangeably. 

The Players Involved

In the ""extended service contract"" business, it's important to know who's who in the process.

Buyer - This is you, the purchaser of the extended service contract.

Contract Provider/Seller - The company that completes the extended service contract application and is responsible for calculating the contract quote and collecting the fee from the Buyer. This could be a manufacturer, a dealer, or an independent warranty provider.

Administrator - The company that actually pays the claims and makes the final decision on what is covered and not covered under the contract. The Administrator usually works directly with the Repair Facility. The Administator takes the largest portion of the ""premium"" (or fee) and places it in a ""claims reserve account"" to pay future claims.

Insurance Company - The company that is financially responsible for making sure claims get paid even if the Administrator were to become insolvent. It's important to ensure the financial status of the insurance company backing the ""claims reserve account"" is solid.

Note: In most states, extended service contracts are not treated as insurance and therefore they are not regulated by state insurance commissioners. However, the best plans are backed by insurance companies as a ""specialty"" line in their overall business. Be cautious of plans backed by ""Risk Retention Groups"" rather than regulated insurance companies.

Service Repair Facility - This is the company (i.e. RV dealer, RV service center, mobile RV tech, etc.) where you have repairs completed. The Repair Facility submits a repair plan and estimated costs to the Administrator for pre-authorization.
RV Extended Warranty Pros & Cons

Again, I'm just like most people when it comes to extended warranties or service contracts. I'm skeptical and I hate paying for a new product and then paying an additional fee with expectations that my new toy, whatever it is, is probably going to break. However, when we are talking about an RV, we're talking about something that is several thousands of dollars and a single repair can have a devastating effect on the bank account.

RV manufacturing is quite unlike auto manufacturing or any other highly controlled manufacturing process. On any given day, any manufacturer can produce an RV that is substandard in one or more of many areas. It doesn't matter what type of RV or how much the RV costs, all manufacturers occasionally make mistakes.

Not only that, but the manufacturers substitute or change components all the time. The components in the same exact RV models may be different due to a shortage from one supplier, a change in component pricing, an engineering decision, etc.

So, let's look at reasons to purchase and reasons not to purchase an extended service contract for your RV.

Reasons To Purchase

Peace of Mind - Answering the following questions may help determine if ""peace of mind"" is a major factor for you.

Do you hate surprise expenses, especially costly RV repairs?Ôªø
Would you sleep better at night knowing that certain major repairs will be covered under an extended service contract? Or would you rather risk it and pay for repairs when and if they are needed?Ôªø
Again, the RV manufacturing process is different. There is a tremendous amount of human involvement. RV factories aren't full of computer programmed robots with precise processes. And humans make mistakes.

Budget Control - We use insurance to manage the risks of major financial outlays in our lives. Extended service contracts can take on that role as far as RV repairs go. More questions for you.

Will the cost of replacing a pricey electrical part or air conditioner or refrigerator or transmission bust your monthly or annual budget? Or do you have a few thousand dollars tucked away in an emergency fund for just these kinds of expenses?
An extended warranty is also somewhat of a hedge against rising prices. The warranty company will pay retail prices at the time of the repair, but the warranty Buyer can be insulated from those price increases. In other words, once you purchase a contract, the Administrator can't come to you in year three asking you for more money because prices have gone up.

Resale Value - This isn't necessarily a major reason to have an extended service contract, but it certainly provides a seller with an advantage and it provides a buyer of a used RV with some peace of mind.

Repair Experts - Though most people don't think of a warranty Adminstrator as looking out for their best interests, it is true that Administrators provide ""checks and balances"" that ensure repair facilities are not overcharging. 

Reasons NOT To Purchase

These are reasons NOT to buy an extended service contract.

You will be disappointed and upset if you buy an extended warranty to:


To cover regular maintenance items
To cover pre-existing items (repairs needed before the service contract is purchased)
To fill gaps in your RV collision and/or comprehensive insurance
To provide roadside assistance (though extended warranties do have some roadside assistance coverage, it's not a primary part of the contract and specialized RV roadside assistance plans are much better)
To cover rust, corrosion, or poorly maintained vehicles

Reasons You May Not Be Able To Get An Extended Warranty On A Used RV

Your motorhome has too many miles (Most companies will write new contracts on motorhomes with mileage up to 100,000 miles; for some companies the limit is 80,000 miles; Wholesale Warranties works with one company that offers coverage up to 125,000 miles)
Your RV is too old (Most companies have age limits for coverage) - Coverage may be available for RVs up to 15 years, but always inquire if your RV is over 10 years old.
Buying An RV Extended Warranty - What To Look For

When buying an extended service contract for your RV, you want value, coverage, contract protection, flexibility and convenience, and service.

Value - Often RV buyers and owners forgo extended service contracts because the cost is hard to justify. Part of the problem is they don't know where or how to shop warranties.

For starters, extended warranties can have huge built-in profits for RV dealers (and auto dealers), and the dealer finance office is often a place where an extended warranty is presented. The extended warranty can actually create more profit than the RV sale itself. Therefore, there is often pressure to buy the warranty at time of sale and pressure to include the cost in the RV financing.

You certainly don't have to buy an extended warranty from your dealer, nor do you need to be in a rush to purchase one. So, if you have decided you would like an extended warranty, shop around and you can save lots of money. The significant savings can make the warranty much more justifiable and reasonable.

Note: Keep in mind that you don't want to wait too long to buy your extended warranty. The longer you wait, the more expensive it will be. In other words, the older your RV gets, the more it will cost to get extended warranty coverage. Just like your health or life insurance gets more expensive as you age, so does an extended warranty. So shop around, but lock in the best pricing you can get as soon as you can.

Now, having said that you can find less expensive extended warranty coverage, be cautious of going too cheap. Be very careful of unsolicited, very, very low priced warranty offers you may receive via the mail, spam email, or telemarketing.

Coverage - It is very important that you understand the coverage being offered. The contracts can be very complicated, but always try to get a copy of the contract so that you have plenty of time to review it before purchase.

Types of coverage

Exclusionary Contract - An exclusionary contract is what you want. This type of coverage includes every mechanical aspect of your RV except for what is specifically ""Exluded from coverage"" or listed as ""Exclusions"" or ""What Is Not Covered"" in the contract.

Note: Exclusionary contracts can have multiple levels of coverage and may have specific provisions that exclude coverage in lower levels and include coverage in higher levels of coverage. Be sure that you request the most comprehensive coverage available.

Listed Component Contract - This type of contract lists only what will be specifically covered. If it's not listed, it's not covered. This type of contract can make it very difficult to determine what is NOT covered.

Note: Though you want comprehensive coverage (the best coverage available in an exlusionary contract), depending on the year and condition of your RV, that coverage may just be too expensive. However, you may still be able to get Listed Component coverage for your motorhome or towable.

Contract Protection - One thing you don't want to have to worry about is completely losing the money you invested in an extended warranty. You hope you don't need the coverage or have any claims, but you certainly don't want your money to disappear leaving you with no coverage at all.

Therefore, it is very important to check out the financial condition of the insurance company backing the Administrators' ""claims reserve account"". Ask about those insurers and get their A.M. Best ratings - look for ""A-rated"" insurers.

Be wary of ""Risk Retention Groups"" that are backing extended service contracts. They are not regulated as well as insurance companies and several have gone bust. There are a few good ones, but I, personally, would want more security.

Flexibility and Convenience - When you are looking for an extended warranty, you want to be able to access repair facilities of your choosing wherever you may be at the time of a breakdown. Be careful of warranties that require you to use certain repair facilities or networks thus limiting where you can go for service.

Service - One thing that is often missing when you buy an extended warranty is service from your Contract Provider (the company from which you bought the contract). Unfortunately, too often there is little or no assistance from the people that sell you an extended warranty. Many simply want to make a sale and wash their hands of any future issues.

A top-notch Contract Provider will offer you after-the-sale service. There can be disputes between repair facilities and Administrators as to the extent of repairs, the labor for repairs, the necessity for repairs, and the coverage for repairs. And there, no doubt, can be finger-pointing going both ways. Often the Buyer is caught in the middle, so it's always a plus to have a Contract Provider that can serve as a mediator to try to work out a solution on your behalf.

Other Items To Look For:

Deductibles - Make sure you know the deductible and whether it is a ""per visit"" or ""per item"" deductible. You don't want to pay a deductible on every repaired part, so make sure that you only pay one deductible per repair facility visit.  Also, higher deductibles can mean a lower overall price of the extended warranty, and savings can be significant (Note: the savings from a higher deductible tend to be more significant for motorized RVs than for towables).
Payment Of Claims - Be sure that the warranty Administrator pays the repair facility directly. It's a big red flag if the Administrator requires you to pay the repair facility out-of-pocket and then submit receipts for reimbursement. Now, with that said, also be cautious of repair facilities that won't work with warranty companies and/or that require you to pay them up front and you have to file your own claims to get reimbursed.
Repair Facility Payment - Be sure that the warranty Administrator will pay the repair facility via corporate credit card. The repair facility doesn't want to wait for a check and the sooner they get paid, the sooner you can be on the road.
Retail Costs - Also, make sure the warranty Administrator pays full retail to the repair facility for parts and labor. They may disagree on the number of hours for the repair or on the parts to be used, but once they work that out, the repair facility should receive full retail prices.
Transferability - Make sure that your extended warranty is transferable. There may be a small transfer fee, but if you sell your RV having the remainder of an extended warranty on it could make for a quicker sale. Of course, in the case of a sale, you may decide to cancel and get a check back (see ""Cancellation"" below) rather than transferring it.
Cancellation - Determine what the cancellation policy is. Can you cancel within 30 or 60 days and get a full refund? What is the refund policy after the initial ""probation"" period? Many extended warranties will give a pro-rated refund based on the time left on the contract if you cancel. There may be an administrative fee to process the cancellation or refund, so know what that cost might be. Also, your refund could be reduced by any claims already paid out (which is reasonable), so be sure to know if that is the case.
Inspections - Does the warranty Administrator require an inspection of your RV? An inspection may be peformed at the time of warranty purchase to identify any ""pre-existing"" conditions. Pre-existing conditions (mechanical issues existing at the time of the purchase of the extended warranty) are not covered, so an inspection helps identify those conditions and may prevent a claim denial later. Inspections are more likely if you are not currently covered by a warranty at the time of the extended warranty purchase.
Additional Benefits - Many extended warranties have towing benefits, roadside assistance benefits, emergency repair provisions, lodging reimbursements, and other minor benefits. Often these have fairly low dollar limits, so know the details and don't expect these benefits to substitute for a specialized RV roadside assistance plan. 
Getting The Most Out Of Your Extended Warranty

In this section, we'll try to explain how to get the most out of your extended warranty. By that I mean, how to use it most effectively and get claims paid without frustration. Stress comes from having expectations too high and those expectations not being met. So, it's important to make sure owners of extended warranties have a realistic expectation of what should happen when a claim is filed.

1. Understand your contract.

Yes, the contract is a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo, but it is important that you understand it. Have someone familiar with warranty contracts review it for you if possible. If that's not possible or too expensive, read over it slowly until you understand it or jot down questions you need answered. Ask the person that is selling you the warranty about provisions you don't understand. Of course, you need to have trust in that individual due to the obvious conflict of interest. Again, the contracts can be complicated, so no one will know every answer to every question, but the good Contract Providers will find the answer for you if they don't know.

With all of the above said, don't be intimidated by the contract. For the most part, repair facilities know what is and isn't covered and Administrators don't go out of their way to deny claims as long as their suspicions aren't raised.

The Administrators have to be on the alert for fraud and misrepresentation so they aren't paying out illegitimate claims at the expense of the honest customers and repair facilities. Yes, the Administrators do sometimes deny claims that certainly aren't fraud or misrepresentation and seem like they should have been approved, but that is the exception rather than the rule, although many incorrectly believe it is the other way around.

2. Understand what is NOT covered.

This is where the most confusion and frustration occurs. When you read a contract, it looks like a lot is not covered, but in an exlusionary contract, at least it's all listed out. Many of the excluded items are common sense (must have a VIN, odometer must be working, items covered by manufacturers warranty or by collision/comprehensive insurance are not covered, etc.).

In some cases, you can add optional coverage for items you are concerned about that are specifically not covered in the base contract.

Many things like lights, batteries, tires, wheels, mirrors, belts, and other items that should be routinely replaced are not covered. Cosmetic items are not covered. General maintenance items are not covered.

Health insurance companies these days are paying for preventative care in order to keep future, larger claims down. But that's not the case for warranty companies - if it ain't broke, there's no coverage. They don't pay for preventative actions that might save them money later.

Be aware of the ""Consequential Damage"" clauses. Many RV extended warranties exclude ""repairs of covered parts caused by failure of non-covered parts"" and ""repairs of non-covered parts caused by failure of covered parts"". These are ""Consequential Damage"" clauses. These clauses can cause denials of large claims, so it might be wise to look at optional ""Consequential Damage"" coverage if it is available.

If you aren't sure whether something should be covered and it is a concern, ask before you buy.

3. Perfom routine, manufacturer-recommended, scheduled maintenance.

A service center can do this or you can do it yourself, but make sure you maintain records and receipts. Proper maintenance is actually a requirement of most extended warranty contracts and failure to perform the maintenance could result in claim denial. If you haven't kept records of your service and maintenance before the warranty purchase, definitely keep them afterwards.

4. Make sure your repair facility gets pre-authorization BEFORE doing any repairs.

Pre-authorization is a vital part of the service contract and it is YOUR responsibility to make sure your repair facility gets that authorization.

It's very important to work with repair facilities that have good warranty departments or personnel that are used to completing the proper procedures for warranty coverage. A good warranty person in a repair facility can make things go very smoothly and reduce the possibility of claims denial. He or she may be the most important person in the whole repair claims process.

Note: Sometimes larger repair facilities can be better for warranty services simply because they have dedicated, experienced warranty personnel.

Still, make sure you know that they get pre-authorization, and be sure you understand what your charges (beyond the deductible) will be if the repair facility doesn't get approval for everything they submitted to the warranty Administrator.

In some cases, the repair facility may accept what the warranty Administrator authorizes and waive the additional costs as it relates to the covered repairs. In some cases, the repair facility may charge you for the difference. Know where you stand before authorizing the repair facility to go forward.

Before we leave this section, let's discuss emergencies. Most extended service contracts have an exception to the ""Pre-authorization rule"" for emergency repairs. But coverage for emergency repairs is very specific, as are the procedures for getting reimbursed. So be sure you understand the emergency repairs provisions.

5. The warranty Administrator will pay what is necessary to complete a covered repair, but usually not for upgrades.

Your repair facility may want to use upgraded parts or you may want to have upgraded parts. In certain circumstanes, the warranty Administrator may cover the upgrade if there is a good, well-documented reason.

However, don't expect that kind of approval, and remember you always have the option of paying the difference for the upgrades.

6. Let the warranty Administrator inspect your RV.

If the warranty Administrator wants to have your RV inspected to verify the condition of the RV and determine if there are any pre-existing conditions, let them inspect. If an independent inspector chosen by the Administrator doesn't document pre-existing conditons, there is less chance of a claims denial on that basis. Also, sometimes the inspectors might bring your attention to a problem you were unaware of.

7. Try not make claims too soon after the contract purchase.

Warranty Administrators don't want to deny claims, but they have to be strict in their reviews in order to protect all the contract holders. Claims made immediately after contract purchase will automatically be under suspicion. Such claims will attract extra scrutiny. In fact, some contracts have short ""waiting periods"" (measured in days or miles), before a claim can be filed.

Of course a breakdown or parts failure may happen right after the contract purchase. Just be aware that it will automatically be reviewed with extra scrutiny. It's more likely an inspector will be sent out to make sure it wasn't a pre-existing condition, and your documented maintenance and service records are even more important.",camping

220,1487777042.0,Can I sleep in a tent that hasn't been put up,"Sorry if this is a stupid question but I've never camped before. I am doing my first hitchhiking trip but I don't want the weight of a tent (and I'm flying with wizzair small cabin bag only) and can't afford a good bivy sack. I've come across a free tent so I want to know if I can sleep in a tent without stakes and pegs just using it as a sort of waterproof cover. 

Wondering if I will have problems with condensation, I can open up an umbrella inside or something to allow air to circulate.

Edit with more info about why I'm not buying a tent
1. Wizzair only allows a small cabin bag so my weight restriction is smaller than a 30L backpack for a 2 month trip- doable but not with a tent
2. I don't believe I can bring stakes and pegs on the plane
3. Will be used for emergencies and beaches/some nice spots in town (not woodlands)
4. I'll be doing a lot of walking with my stuff around towns and hitchhiking, I heard you shouldn't carry more than 10% of your body weight (4.7kg for me, and I'm not very strong so I don't like carrying too much) and a tent would bring my bag 4.5kg to 6.5kg. 7kg is alsolutely miserable for me.
5. If it's raining lots I'll book a hostel rather than sleeping outside
6. There's no walmart in my country
7. The only bivys I can afford have really bad reviews on amazon for being soaked with sweat in the morning
8. I have a light sleeping bag and tarp so I could just use that
9. I like being creative and working with what I have
10. Thank you for ensuring I don't suffocate on my holiday

Conclusion: leaving the tent at home, bringing my sleeping bag and tarp, will consider the bivy, thanks for your help!",camping

222,1689265265.0,Legitimate question. Why do some of you guys go glamping at state parks during peak season and then spend your time going online complaining about people's etiquette? What did you expect when you were going to the park that's been booked out a month in advance?,"Imo people are going camping with unrealistic expectations. When you go to a park with 60 lots in sequence peak season it's not going to be the same as going off season or dispersed camping. I think people are setting themselves up to be disappointed. When we go camping you gotta be prepared for everything. Heat, cold, rain, drought, snow etc. But this doesn't just include gear, this includes preparing your mind. Know what you're getting yourself into and plan ahead. I hate seeing so many of you guys having such a bad experience when you go out. This should be an awesome time for you, don't let people piss in your cheerios


Edit: The way some of you guys are responding I don't think you understand what I'm saying. Yall taking this to mean it's OK to be a jerk etc. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying everyone knows what certain sites are going to be like during certain times. But yall still show up during those times and then act surprised.

231,1694235523.0,Why are the batteries dead every morning?,"Edit::: to include this information for clarity.

The 2022 model camper came with these batteries. 

(2) Interstate SRM-27 Deep Cycle Marine/RV. 88AH. 160RC. 750MCA. 12V. They are connected black/black, red/red. 

The only thing operating is the fridge. And NO, it can not run on propane. It's 12v Electric (it's on a fuse, not a breaker). It's a GE model GPV10FSNBSB. 12VDC, 13.5amps.

The inverter is also drawing from the 12v system while in standby mode, so I will try turning that OFF at night.

We have the solarflex400i solar panel system (2) 200watt panels and a Xantrex Freedom X2000 inverter. We only use 120v outlets during the day when the panels are operating efficiently. Typically, as the sun sets, our batteries are at full capacity

:::::


We have a Keystone Bullet with two deep cycle lead acid batteries. They are connected by jumper wires. When boondocking, we use the installed solar panels and inverter to power the 120v system, but the water pump, refrigerator, cabin lights, slide out, awning, power jack and power stabilizers all run on 12v. 

The battery is fully charged at the end of the day, but by morning, the fridge is warm, freezer is thawed and the lights flicker. The water pump is sluggish. 

We can monitor the battery system and solar panels by apps, and the battery app will indicate slow but steady drops as soon as the solar panels are done working for the day. It also shows the amount of useage, and calculates how long the system will operate without being recharged. One thing I noticed was that it suggested a ""remaining useage time"" of roughly 10 hours. This would explain why by 7am, our fridge is getting warm and nothing works, but it doesn't explain why, and what could possibly be draining those batteries so quickly?!?!

Do we seriously need to move to Lithium batteries to boondock overnight? That doesn't seem right to me? All lights are off. No appliances are plugged in. The water pump is off. 

I've checked nealy every rv thread online, been to the manufacturers website and even talked to customer support. It's all circular talk with no solutions. The dealer will charge us $175/hr to evaluate, but they couldn't guarantee that they could discover the problem in an 8 hour day...

So, here I am, looking for the free advice.

First of all, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post, but I really have no idea what I'm doing and I need advice.

My girlfriend and I are 16 years old, and we each live with our parents, who are ALWAYS FUCKING HOME. To get alone time together, our solution has been to find a secluded spot in a forest near us and lay down a plastic tarp and a sleeping bag. This is nice and works fairly well, but we are interested in establishing something more permanent and cozy so I am exploring the option of having a tent set up full time that we can visit.

I really have no idea what I'd be looking for in camping equipment, so this is where I need some help. Obviously, portability is not a concern. But does the tent material have to be a specific kind of fabric for continuous exposure to rain for months on end? Does the tent need to have something specific about its shape and structure to deal with heavy snowfall?

Additionally, what would I look for in a location for the tent? It must be flat, obviously. But is it essential to be on top of a hill to prevent flooding, or in the shade to prevent sun damage?

Finally, what kind of maintenance would be required of a long term tent setup?

Here is what I'm currently thinking of buying:

* [RioRand Double Layer 2 Person 4 Season Aluminum Rod Outdoor Camping Tent Topwind 2 Plus with Snow Skirt](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00KGQ2PDI/)

* [OUTAD Waterproof Camping Tarp Tent Footprint](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01HDBE2HU/) (do I even need a tent footprint?)

* [Ohuhu 86''x 59'' Huge Double Sleeping Bag](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00T4BHYLY/)

Are these good choices?

Additionally, I'm looking for the following:

* Good quality pillows to keep in the tent

* a good quality foam mattress type thing to layer the bottom of the tent with and increase comfort

* a sealable, scent-proof bag to store snacks in

Again, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing here so any help or advice is greatly appreciated. If someone has experience with long-term tent setups I would love to hear about that. Thank you for any help.",camping

277,1481303060.0,My Scary Camping/Stranger experience,"First I want to say that I was not for sure to put this as a scary stranger encounter or scary camping story. Also I have a problem writing things so if it seems a little weird sorry about it.
Over this past summer I was camping with a couple long time family friends. For safety purposes I will call them Bill and Lauren. But thru out the whole previous summer Bill Lauren their kids and I went camping at their camp site. Also with us were Lauren‚Äôs twin sister Ashley and her husband Tom and their kids. 
We usually went there for every weekend that it was nice outside but I‚Äôm just going to talk about the day I had the scary encounter. To start from the beginning of the day we all arrived at the camp site about noon we had some fun while swimming in the pond that the camp grounds had but I couldn‚Äôt shake off the feeling that I was being watched from the distance beyond the tree lines. But I ended up not trying to think too much about it at all because I was having some fun while swimming in the hot Ohio weather. If you live in Ohio or ever spent a full summer day in it you will understand on how the weather patterns can be real stupid at times but it doesn‚Äôt get as hot as it does in other states that get it real bad thou. We all decided to get out of the water to get dried off because we were going to cook some meat on a grill before game 7 of the Cavs vs Warriors game came on. I happened to look near the pathway that lead to the camper that Bill Lauren their kids and I were staying at and all I could see was a man just standing there looking in our general direction and when he noticed I spotted him he ran into the trees so I was initially freaked out about this but I decided not to tell Bill Lauren Tom or Ashley. So we ended up grilling some steak and some other cow meat. We ended up getting a lot of meat because Tom works at a factory that does a lot with putting all the meats in the packages so he ended up bringing some of it with him to cook. So we got done eating about 630 and since the game didn‚Äôt start until 7pm I believe we all went to Bill and Laurens camper and started a bonfire. And just talked until the game on and we listened to the game on a Toms phone since we didn‚Äôt have a TV with cable. We all didn‚Äôt go to bed until a little after 11pm because we all stayed up to see who won and you all already know the cavs won sadly. So we all went to bed I stayed up until about 1130 because I like being alone for a little bit before going to bed so I watched the fire for a little bit. Before I went to bed I put out the fire so nothing really happens. I had to sleep in a tent outside because the camper that Bill and Lauren had was too small to put another person in there. 
So I ended up falling asleep when I got into the tent. I woke up around 2 am because I thought I heard something and I‚Äôm a real light sleeper. And after a few seconds of that weird feeling you get right as soon as you get up I realized that the fire was going again and so I sent Lauren a text asking if she was outside and happened to start the fire again or if Bill or any of the kid‚Äôs and she responded no and she thought I was still awake. I only sent her this because I saw someone standing near the fire and also the fire. When we both responded that it wasn‚Äôt us we heard a maniacal laugh. So Lauren called 911to get the cops to come and I didn‚Äôt really know what to do because I didn‚Äôt know if the person had a weapon or not so I decided just to try and wait until the cops showed up. Unfortunately, the person that was out their started to come near my tent and I was a sitting duck and I know what you guys think why didn‚Äôt I just run away when I had a chance to. For one I think the person would have gotten to me before I even made it out the tent because of how loud the zipper was to it. So the person decided to try and unzip the tent door so I decided to take the chance and kick the persons head when he went to get the zipper luckily it knocked the person back and the person stumbled down the hill that I put the tent on. Luckily I had a flashlight with me so I shined the light towards the person and found out that it was the man I saw from earlier that day. He started to charge at me and luckily I took some karate classes so I defended myself to the best I could. When I went to kick the man he grabbed my foot and threw me to the ground and luckily we could hear the cops sirens coming. The man decided to run into the woods area. 
I ended up telling the cops everything that happened and I‚Äôm not for sure if they decided to look for the man in the woods area and found him. Turns out he was just a creepy homeless man that was living near the woods. I still try and figure out why he targeted me out of all the other people that were at the camp sight. I‚Äôm just glad that my anxiety didn‚Äôt kick in. So creepy man I just hope that we never meet again.

278,1411083198.0,I want to go spend a year in the wilderness. Away from everything. Please help me prepare properly.,"I have a ton of hiking and camping experience. I've been to almost all state parks and a ton of the national forests. I don't, on the other hand, have much hunting experience. I don't really know where to begin with this, as far as where I should go or what I should bring. I have a decent amount of gear. But, I think, most of it is more applicable to 3-5 day trips. Less long term stuff. I would really love to go to Alaska, because it has the largest national forests, but it is pretty far from where I am, so I think I'd like to stay in the lower 48.

50 y/o American here with two boys age 6 and 8.  I grew up in the rural Deep South with horses, four wheelers, hunting and fishing etc (though at the time I longed for the big mountains of the Rockies.)

My boys so far have only lived in the generic suburbs of various teeming metropolises - but like most boys they love to camp and ski at least in small doses.  I feel the urban environment sucking out my soul.  I assume it‚Äôs doing the same to them. 

I can retire with a government pension in 4 years. Thanks to living somewhat frugally, I have enough savings that I don‚Äôt have to work at the relatively young age of 54 as long as I live modestly.  I‚Äôm in good health and shape. 

I‚Äôve decided that life is too short to do what most of my colleagues do, which is to start a second career in the private sector and slave away after they qualify to retire from government service. 

My wife will continue to work, as she isn‚Äôt ready to retire. 

I used to  half jokingly say I was going to be ski patrol in the winter and a whitewater rafting guide in the summer while I was still fit enough.  Now I think that‚Äôs pretty indulgent and my thoughts are more about spending time with my boys and providing experiences I didn‚Äôt have.  I need to do it before they get too old and too cool to hang out with their old man.  

There‚Äôs got to be something better than them playing video games and me shuttling them back and forth to soccer practice all summer. 

What would you do and where would you go?  Rent a cabin on a remote lake in Alaska or Canada practice self reliance, then do it again each year. Thru hike for the summer? Go on epic canoe trip (where?)  Get them started whitewater kayaking (one of my old passions that I wish I had started much younger)? Etc. 

After summer is over we‚Äôd go back to my wife/their mom. 

I‚Äôm not adverse to buying property somewhere either that we could return to each year and that I might eventually retire too full time when they are out of school. 

TL:DR. Give me your suggestions on providing epic outdoor experiences for 11 and 12 y/o boys for a full summer.",camping

Now returning it would have cost 20‚Ç¨ for whatever reason which was I think more than it cost or similar  (just under 20‚Ç¨, max. 30‚Ç¨ (?)).

Don't worry, I never used it and got a proper one from Decathlon after asking staff loads of questions.

Now I'm decluttering my things and wondering what I should do with this thing. I'm thinking of just throwing it away and giving away the gas cartridges.

About the camping stove (pardon, idk the correct terms):

The blue metal is curved or simply not straight causing the whole stove to be not straight.

In yellow, the part where the gas goes through and turns into a flame. It is of two parts, the lower, and the upper with the holes where the flames would go through. That top part will never be fully screwed. It will always be a bit loose so the mechanism seems to be faulty too. If you turn it and you think you almost turned it to the end, it becomes loose again.

In green, those two parts are also loose and not safe to use at all. It does not sit on the yellow part. If you bump it, it will all collapse.

Is the yellow part even remotely safe to use? 

Should I just throw it all away? 

I included pictures of the gas cartridges. Are they safe to use? Is it safe to give them to someone? If not, where do I get rid of them?

1. Should I be worried about snakes or any creepy crawlies? Or animal of any sort?

2. How do people charge their phones while camping? We could charge while driving, but I imagine there will be days we won't be driving. Extra batteries can only do so much.

3. Do the bathrooms in the campsite have hair dryers? If it's cold and I wash my hair how do I dry it? Not thinking vanity, thinking health reasons and that I need to be dry to sleep in the sleeping bag.

I told the kids to stay away from it, but of course my toddler didn‚Äôt understand and despite my best efforts he went near it multiple times.

What could we have done? I reported it to the campground but they said they don‚Äôt spray poison ivy in the park. Does a campground have a responsibility to keep campsites free of poison ivy? Should we have sprayed it ourselves on day one? We were there for six days.

UPDATE: I am NOT going to spray in the campsite. I did not realize that spraying was such a big deal, which is why I posted the question about what to do in the first place. A state park ranger told me that while he does not spray and he cannot tell me to spray, he wouldn‚Äôt care if I did since the problem was so bad.

435,1688603779.0,A plea to the stoner primitive campers outs there: use WAG bags,"Twice in the last year (including this morning), my dogs have ingested human feces - unburied or lightly buried - at primitive campsites. Many people don't know this, but when you ingest THC (edibles) you actually shit out a lot of it, and it's still toxic to dogs. So, I woke up this morning to my dogs shaking uncontrollably, unable to control their legs, peeing on themselves, the whole nine yards. And this is the second time in 6 months.

Obviously id like it if my dogs didn't eat shit, but human feces is highly attractive to a lot of animals, and 90% of us don't bury our shit appropriately. I have been guilty of this myself. If you're eating weed and doing it though, you're sickening a lot of animals. 

So this is my plea to please use WAG bags. They're way more LNT and will do a lot more to preserve the ecology of the places we like to camp. They're also a lot less work than digging an appropriate hole.

For the sake of the animals, from a fellow stoner

Edit: for those questioning whether it was THC - and  who are still actually talking about the waste disposal issue - we did tests at a vet, dogs tested positive. We reconstructed the scenario for vets on both occasions, and in both instances they were the ones that provided the mechanism. I don't think we're at ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" level, but I think it's more than reasonable to claim this is what happened. I'm a big stoner myself and have nothing against THC, so quit acting like I'm attacking anyone. Beyond that, we don't even have to be talking about THC here. Could be any prescription drugs or whatever substance comes out of your ass that is toxic to animals. I just used THC because it's what happened to me, and there are obviously a lot more users out there these days. Anyway, there's another comment in here somewhere that gives some reporting of this happening in various places. Find it if you care",camping

I am just wondering if this is normal? I felt it was inconsiderate of them to bring their toddlers here, but on the other hand I can understand the want to go camping and expose your children to that kind of life. But why bring them to a public campground? There are plenty of campgrounds without sites so close to one another. Is it reasonable to expect peace and quiet at a public campground?",camping

I arrived, loved it and have been back every weekend since - found a neat ¬£5 a night ($7) camping spot, right on the beach and it literally is incredible. Hearing the waves crash just metres away every night... Heaven on earth. 

I posted some pictures on my blog - http://www.batmanswritehand.com/2/post/2014/01/another-weekend-in-sayulita-time-to-go-camping.html and will be writing a more detailed post over the weekend (if any of you wanna check it out) but just thought I would share pictures of what I think is the most beautiful camping spot....

460,1689866740.0,How to find a campsite for a tent,"Seems like a simple task yet is ended up being very difficult

I recently went on a trip with my girlfriend to the smokeys. We tried finding a place to setup a simple dome tent and had a lot of trouble. We went on a website with a map and list of sites and found a place near Knoxville to camp for a nominal fee. When we got there it was all RV's and no vaccancies. We ended up driving into Knoxville and settling for a Walmart parking lot. That was not ideal. I got the tent setup and it was very noisy from the highway nearby. Also they were doing something sounded like pressure washing at 3-5AM and at 6 they opened and started blasting music.

Can anyone tell me a better way to find a simple camping site?

468,1627900831.0,Why don't more tents have darkened bedrooms?,"Got a large first tent earlier in the year which a darkened bedroom and it is an amazing feature. You sleep so much better when the bright sun is not making your entire living space really bright at the crack of dawn. 

I've been aiming to get a smaller, lighter tent I can put up myself for solo adventures with my mtb (not necessarily bikepacking, just more time at further away trails without having to pay for a hotel/airbnb every time) and it's quite annoying to find a tent that ticks every box other than having a darkened room.

Why aren't more tents like this? I'd have thought it would be an almost standard feature these days. Is it weight? Do most people just prefer to not have a darkened room?

I'm considering leaving it until next year to see if more good small tents have this feature.

Has anyone here tried DIY darkened bedrooms which I've read a bit about? Is it as much of a pain in the ass as I expect it be? Or even potentially trying to size up another tents bedroom with a darkened bedroom and buying that as a replacement part? I know there's the option of a sleep mask but it's not quite the same.

For what its worth, I was considering the Vango Knoydart 300 for its feature/size/weight, though the closest I can really find to it with a darkened room is a Coleman Chimney Rock 3 Plus which is considerably heavier (and larger).",camping

The wind all night was howling. I thought that the tornado from Nashville had made its way to Massachusetts. The wind was peaceful to sleep to, and I slept the best I had in a long time. I wake up the next morning, and am unusually chilly. My toes are shivering. I personally sleep better when cold so I shrugged it off and went back to bed. About an hour later I‚Äôm still cold. My hands felt like I had been sleeping outside all night. I grabbed an oversized hoodie, throw it on and get back in bed. 

At this point I glance down at my phone. I see a text from my mother dear. We had lost power overnight. I began laughing. Part of the reason I came down here alone for the night was, to see what living alone would be like. Would I like it? Would I get lonely? Could I maintain it all? 

Fingers crossed the power comes back on. But if it doesn‚Äôt, we will live out this adventure. I call it camping in your own house. My friends will be here later today & we can just camp all together. We can‚Äôt feel guilty if we eat too much take out, or spend too much money dining out because we just can‚Äôt cook.

Camping is a great way to escape from the ""real world"". It can separate you from the stress that you experience at work and home, giving you time to recharge. The article below is packed with useful camping tips that can be used in the future.

Always locate your shelter before dark when you are camping. Once darkness falls, it is very difficult to set up camp. That is particularly true if you aren't used to the blackness of the wilderness. Do not wind up in this position. Seek shelter and make camp for the night well before darkness sets in.

Make sure you have a survival kit with you during your entire camping trip. Survival kits should contain waterproof matches, a survival knife, a first aid kit, a flare gun and water purifying tablets. This kit can keep you alive! Carry it at all times.

Double-check any medical insurance. You may need an additional policy when you are traveling on your camping trip. This is even more of a factor if you travel to another country to go camping, like Canada. Be sure you're prepared to be on the safe side!

A bandanna or a handkerchief can be beneficial to bring on your trip. Such an item can be used as a carrying bag, a potholder, a hand towel, a blotter or a paper towel. It has a multitude of uses and should be an essential part of your camping gear.

The lint from your dryer's lint filter will help you start a campfire. Before you go camping, start saving lint from the dryer's filter. To make it easy to collect dryer lint, simply hang a bag next to the dryer and fill with your lint. Just grab your bag of dryer lint and go on camping day.

A camping trip is a fun way to spend time. It gives you the opportunity to bond with nature and relieve yourself of the stresses of your daily life. The advice in this piece will help you transform any camping experience into the trip of a lifetime.",camping

We're going to a state park, Pendernales falls, and I really don't know what to expect when it comes to how strict their going to be on rules. Any one with experience please give me some feed back! 

First off we plan on drinking. Obviously a campsite won't proudly display that underaged kids can get away with drinking but as long as we're not obnoxious and we just hangout do you think it'll be alright? We could always poor the alcohol into different containers but even then I don't think it would be difficult to figure out what were doing. A few of us do have fake ID's if there's any chance that would help. 

Secondly we booked the campsite awhile ago and at the time only 8 or us were going. One more friend joined and we went to book another campsite because of the eight people max rule but by that time there was no more open sites. If nine of us are there will they notice? Or more importantly will they care? The park also has day only entry so I was thinking a few of us could enter separately and  meet up inside. Incase you can't tell I'm grasping at straws here haha. 

The last thing I'm curious about is the quiet time. I saw that state parks have a quiet time between 10 p.m. And 6 a.m. I was wondering, in your experience, is that rule typically followed. I wouldn't want to be a disturbance to any fellow campers so if it is we'll happily oblige but once again just trying to figure out what to expect.

540,1694164323.0,Camp cooking on a budget with minimal equipment.,"I do 3 or 4 day trips camping, about 8 times a year. I have minimal cooking equipment but not looking for suggestions to buy any equipment outside of $30 range. I have a 'camp' cooking pot, my kitchen spoon fork and knife. Tent camping with usually 5-10 minute hikes to the campsite. Favorite campsite has a walkin boat launch that I portage my canoe to. 

I'd like some ideas for food outside of what I currently am bringing. Time spent cooking at camp isn't much concern, I only travel about 5 hours a day. Camp cooking ability, equipment, and budget is though. Packing equipment for food is minimal outside of zip locks atm.

Cheap means I fit the stereotype of a male that has lived alone for 20 years. Anything ingredients outside of basic spices and condiments at home would mean they need to be bought. Can probably be afforded but won't be used outside of a backpacking trip. Any ingredients will probably never be used outside of a backpacking trip.

Price and prep is a concern. Google searches seem to be upper class or for long trips. Keep in mind I'm doing most of my treks eating hot dogs, beans, tuna, tortillas, and some vegetables currently.

Places I go almost always have a firepit and a grate. Access to plenty of firewood and water is never an issue. I don't travel far each day so typically spend most of my day at camp.

546,1686540502.0,Jaffel irons don't fit bread any more and that is an actual conspiracy,"This is a pet peeve of mine that has become an source of petty but sincere frustration, and I came here specifically to have a (good-natured) rant about it.

It is impossible now to buy a new jaffel iron that isn't far too big for the bread, meaning it fails to clamp and seal the edges, and every jaffel is a messy, hands-burnt-by-boiling-cheese, beans-in-your-lap experience. They don't cook properly because the sandwich in the iron is completely unconstrained in all dimensions. The jaffel in the iron is like PC games in the 2000s where you got an A4 size box containing one loose CD in a plastic sleeve. The jaffel isn't held fast against the heat-transfer surface, and the halves go into misalignment from the first time the jaffel is flipped. Upon opening, the top half is more likely to stick to the iron than to the corresponding half, tearing the jaffel along its critical latitudinal axis. The jaffel cannot be released into the camp bowl by the usual sideways suspension followed by a little shaking, because even gentle agitation will tear the loosely constructed abomination apart.

I have heard theories that this is due to shrinkflation of sliced bread dimensions. Do not believe this crisis-denying propaganda. I have compared newer irons I have bought to my parents' irons I used as a kid and the new ones are 10--20% wider and thicker to a similar degree. What's more, to buy an older one (whether square or my personal favourite, round), they are either second hand 'antiques', or hipster 'craft' items, both difficult and expensive to attain. No, no, NO, this is not ok. We need to able to go into a regular camping store and purchase a jaffel iron that can actually create the eponymous priduct, utilising slices of bread not baked by a being living at the top of a magical beanstalk.

The true mystery here is, *how did this happen*?! The humble jaffel preceeded and inspired the modern toasted sandwich, and modern sandwich toasters cleary are designed to produce a more technological version of what once was the noble jaffel. So the world of production and manufacturing *KNOW* the criticality of effective edge-sealing to create the perfect jaffel yet somehow the free market has not taken care of it for its more wholesome campfire-genic ancestor.

This is, therefore, some kind of conspiracy. Either the government or the corporations who own them are somehow limiting the market's ability to supply us with this critical product. I suspect it is maybe electrical kitchenware companies trying to monopolise the two bits of toasted bread with anything inbetween market, or perhaps a foreign power trying to disrupt our sense of national identity. But what do I know I'm just a hungry dude whose searing beans, cheese, and leftover tuna mornay from the billy have just spewed out from between the half-toasted slices that surrounded the embarrassment we're encouraged to pretend is a real jaffel like it now does at least once every camping trip, and I needed to get this message out.",camping

So, me and a couple buddies planned a 3 day trip to Kawartha Highlands last summer to end off the school year. We planned it two days before the trip giving us just enough time to figure out transportation, gather the food, tent, canoe & tools... The morning of the trip it was already off to a bad start, my friends were supposed to meet me at my house by 9 in order to mount the canoe and pack the only ""Car"" we could borrow, a (4 person Chevy Sonic), we ran into some issues and eventually but eventually hit the road at 11:30 with a 12foot aluminum canoe barely strapped to the roof and a car packed to the brim with luggage, food and people.

&#x200B;

After some gnarly traffic and nearly killing ourselves over a dozen times, we arrived at the lake, and boy was it bigger than it looked on the map. We get out of the car and take the Canoe of the roof, only to find one of the foam sliders we used to mount the Canoe was gone, luckily we were fine and we proceeded to see if the bloody thing would even float (luckily it did, kinda). So we packed up and started paddling to site that we thought was about a 2 hour trip away, wrong. After nearly killing each other we arrived to our site about 5 hours later with about an hour of light to spare. We packed up camp, made some ""food' and went straight to the tent to smoke and drink some... (I'm gonna stop here for legal reasons lol).

&#x200B;

To keep things short, we packed up the next day and headed another 5 hours out of the park. There were a few more hiccups (Tornado warning, Friend bailing out, Friend getting lost, Arguing, Canoe almost sinking...) but we were alive, and made a lot of great and not-so-great memories.

Just how susceptible are down bags to losing insulation when wet? I understand down of course loses all of its desirable qualities when wet. But how wet are we talking? I live in Alabama, where it is not uncommon to get a torrential downpour. Obviously that hopefully won't happen while camping, but it is a possibility. Am I straight up screwed if that occurs? Or is it more a matter of ""dry off before you get in the bag""? The bag I am looking at in particular is the Nemo Disco.

Right now I figured I'll light a fire where I want my tent, warm up the rocks it's going to be on, then after the fire completely dies, put some hay down between the rocks and the tent, then between they hay, a thick blanket. Then have the tent on top of that.

For the tent itself I'm thinking of putting a blanket over top of it and having one inside on the floor. Over top of the tent and blanket, a tarp to hold the blanket down and to add a little more insulation. 

I 5gal jug of hot water wrapped in foil and a blanket is reserve heat and to heat up the whole tent.

For sleeping I figure a sleeping bag wrapped in a blanket and a blanket on the inside is my best bet.

Note: both my sleeping bag and tent are pretty cheap and not made for supper cold weather. I'm also thinking of some half warmers incase of emergency but I'm looking for a cheap option. I'm going tomorrow and didn't think of asking y'all until just now.

First you pick your camp choose the approximate area you want your camp to have.  This is the easy part.  This should be done your first night for reasons that become obvious. Start with the most obvious trails into camp then mark your territory.  Piss away. Do this the first day, if no other campers around, and night.  Piss all around the area you want in your camp.  If one of your campers is a big beer drinker, let them in on it.

How much more capable are campers to survive a difficult time if the world took a bad turn,  than an average person that doesn't camp as a hobby and have a bunch of camping gear?

Note: What got me thinking about this was the cold weather in Texas recently, when the winter storm happened, people died because they simply couldn't stay warm.

A problem that most of us could have solved simply with a tent and a sleeping bag. 

Maybe even a Mylar blanket, a fire and some wool socks if we really needed to...

Then I began thinking about how the homeless population often turn to tents and camping equipment to survive as well...

I'm an avid camper, and have been for a while. I like to think that I am pretty camp savvy and like to uphold park rules because I believe they make sense and are in everybody's best interest.  

That being said, I do break one. I bring my dog on trails that forbid dogs.  
  
My understanding is that dogs aren't allowed because they can intimidate wildlife and other campers, and they can go off trail, and they poop indiscriminately.  
So... I hike with my dog. He's 6.5 lbs, he loves camping, I pick up his poop, and he never leaves the trail (or my side).  
I know it's not fair and that maybe some people think I'm acting ""above the law,"" but the truth is my dog just likes the hikes and I don't feel like I'm harming anything or anyone by doing it.  
Is it so wrong? 
  
I have been to many backwoods trails with him, and only at one location did I have any negative reactions by fellow hikers.  
I just want some perspective here!  


EDIT:  
I see people are quite heated on the issue. I appreciate the constructive feedback! I will definitely be spending more time looking for trails that he is allowed on, and be more cautious about bringing him to areas where predators and wildlife are more susceptible to his impact. That being said I do not believe that ""rules are rules"" and will operate as well-informed as I can be (which is why I posted this!) and act accordingly. Thanks for the input!

764,1596287817.0,Starting to hate campfires,"The last few trips we've taken, there have been fire bans due to dry weather. We were kinda bummed at first, but during our last portaging trip I started to appreciate the lack of camp fire. Obviously in the summer it's not needed for warmth, cooking over a campfire is fun but actually not very practical especially on long trips. But we had so much more time in the evening because we weren't mucking around with fires or cleaning up after them. And the peace and quiet and DARK of the woods is so nice. You can hear and see more wildlife. The fireflies are brighter. But still, we always missed marshmallows, that hanging around a fire chatting etc

Then last week we went camping with family. We were thrilled there was no fire ban because a couple of the kids we were taking had never gone before and we wanted them to experience it. 

Within an hour of nightfall I was done with fires. The whole campground was covered in smoke, you couldn't see anything, you could feel the air quality getting worse. In big campgrounds, everyone lighting fires all summer long must have a negative effect on the ecosystems we're supposedly there to enjoy and protect. And there aren't nearly enough rules about fires imo. Obviously fire bans are easier to enforce, but some idiot must have been burning plastic or something other than camp provided wood on one of our nights because the smell was horrendous.

Anyone feel the same? It seems like it's a completely ingrained part of camping culture here, I wonder if we'll ever move to just expecting everyone to have fewer and smaller fires.",camping

- [This tent](http://imgur.com/a/lHtJe) is the same price, but it says it has a ventilation opening in the back on the bottom. Which my green one doesn't have, it only has ventilation at the top and at the top of the door.

- [This tent](http://imgur.com/a/CfwfO) seems to have better ventilation if I open both doors but let the bug net be still in place. But it does look like it's very hard to set up...

778,1694349744.0,Tips for making tent poles out of wood dowels,"Recently, I've started using a tarp for shelter and I'd like to make a couple tent poles out of wooden dowels that I can pack away with my tarp. It is easy enough to find a stick to use as a pole, but I'd like to make something to keep as a permanent part of my kit. I could buy a collapsible pole, but I want to make them.

Have any of you ever made your own tent poles? How did you do it and what did you use? I'm thinking about using hardwood dowels and some type of pipe connector. I'd like to make 2-4 poles that are about 4 feet long and have interchangeable sections that can be used to vary the length of the pole set. Maybe making each section 12-18 inches (30-45 cm). 

What are your ideas, or what have you made?

Edit: These poles will not be used in a dome tent and will not need to bend. I guess ""dowel"" has different meanings to different people. So to clarify, I'd like to use a wooden set of oak poles to make a collapsible set of oak poles. The diameter is still up for debate.

Edit 2 (The Great Bamboo-zling): Bamboo is a great material and is actually slightly harder than oak. However, bamboo has some serious drawbacks for the use intended here. First, bamboo is incredibly flexible and strong... when it's green. Once bamboo dries, it becomes hard and brittle. Think about a sailing ship's mast, if it were made of green bamboo it would bend all over the place. And, if it were made of dry bamboo, it would snap and shatter. The poles I'm trying to build are kinda like a ship's mast, except they won't need to bend anywhere near as much as a ship's mast does.

Edit 3: I have never heard of anyone using bamboo for anything other than gardening or decorating until today.",camping

799,1473528745.0,Looking for advice on Merino underwear (awkward details inside),"I'm 6'2"" but I only wear small briefs, because I need to . . .

- be able to hold my head up high

This makes it slightly difficult to find pairs that do what I need them to do in the front without giving me wedgies in the back. I also really need to feel the band in the crease where my leg meets my pelvic bone.

818,1693077012.0,Jaded Camper,"I wanted to go camping this weekend. I haven't gone camping for years. I saw this really neat tent that attaches to my SUV online and it really inspired me to get out there into nature but also have the safety and creature comforts of a vehicle. I was pumped and bought a lot of gear and fun stuff to do while out there, all by myself\*.

I reserved a spot about 40min away from my home right by a lake. The place I had reserved was in an area that many people speak lovely about with fond memories from that past. -So I couldn't go wrong!- I was so excited and wouldn't shut up about camping by myself this weekend when talking to my coworkers and I know they are going to be asking me about my experience come Monday morning...

\-IDK? I guess every time I have gone camping in the past, someone else (parents/friends) had already known the place we would go to and camp. We would go to a place and be left alone to do fun stuff without much of anyone else being around. I wanted to be ""alone and far away from society and commune with nature or something""? 

I showed up at the spot after being lost for about 20mins and I guess I had passed it 2 times already thinking the road leading that way was for RVs only. I am so jaded. The National Parks website stated the area I booked was for ""tent camping only"" and that you could also park your vehicle close to the site you reserved. Or something of that nature. 

It was almost all RVs and it was brimming with people. It was like Times Square on New Year's Eve mixed with a poorly constructed refuge camp and some trailer park BS to the mix. It was loud, obnoxious, and in no way ""alone and far away from society and commune with nature or something""? 

I would like to know what I did wrong. I paid money for a site that ended up much worse than staying at home in my apartment. What do I need to know in order to avoid these situations? 

Can I find a place to get with nature? Or is this what ""Nature is now""?

833,1688302142.0,Menu for 7 day trip...without use of campfires,"My family of four is going to camp for 7 days, but its looking almost certain there'll be a complete fire ban at the park. We can cook using gas stoves but not wood fires or even an enclosed charcoal grill.

Breakfast is pretty straightforward: coffee, cereal, toast, eggs, fruit.

Lunches: sandwiches, cheese, crackers, fruit, tuna/chicken salad, soup if its cold, etc.

Dinners are where it gets complicated. I usually make burgers, hotdogs, sausages, chicken breasts, or fish on a campfire. The Coleman stove is mostly reserved for stuff that needs to be boiled or just warmed up like those packaged rice or pasta side dishes from Uncle Ben's or Lipton or whatever.

I could cook hotdogs or sausages in a frying pan on a Coleman but it just doesn't seem the same.

Any suggestions?",camping

You aren't sure what's out there; snakes, bears, wild monkeys, boars, scorpion. I am not sure how many of those animals overlap in any given part of the world.

Would it make sense instead of making just a fire pit, to  create a circle about 15 feet wide(if you have the clearance) of logs, bark, twigs etc of fire with maybe a 45-90 degree opening on one side. I'd imagine a lot of the animals that might attempt to come towards you in your sleep will be repelled by the mostly ring of fire, and the little opening would be enough for you to walk in an out of as needed.

Again I've never gone camping so if you think the idea is problematic try constructive criticism.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the input, I now know that it would be quite the undertaking to maintain a fire of that size, and I overestimated the desire for animals to bother a snoring human alone in the wilderness, it would be more suitable just to hang whatever foodstuffs I have by a tree far away from where I am staying, get bug spray and a normal size campfire, Thanks.

&#x200B;

**Truffle Mushroom Risotto:**

Turn your camping pot into a vessel for a creamy and luxurious risotto.

* Ingredients: Arborio rice, vegetable broth, dried wild mushrooms (porcini or shiitake), fresh mushrooms (cremini or portobello), truffle oil, white wine, shallots (finely chopped), garlic (minced), butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.
* Instructions: Rehydrate the dried mushrooms in hot water. In the pot, saut√© shallots and garlic in butter until fragrant. Add Arborio rice and toast for a minute. Deglaze with white wine and allow it to absorb. Gradually add vegetable broth, stirring constantly until the rice is creamy and cooked. Saut√© fresh mushrooms separately and add to the risotto. Stir in the rehydrated mushrooms, a drizzle of truffle oil, and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

&#x200B;

**Lemon Herb Salmon with Couscous:**

Impress yourself with a flavorful salmon dish accompanied by fluffy couscous.

* Ingredients: Salmon fillet, lemon, fresh herbs (such as dill and thyme), couscous, vegetable broth, butter, asparagus spears, salt, and pepper.
* Instructions: Season the salmon fillet with salt, pepper, and lemon zest. In the pot, melt butter and sear the salmon until cooked through. Remove and set aside. In the same pot, bring vegetable broth to a boil and add couscous. Remove from heat, cover, and let it steam. Meanwhile, blanch asparagus in boiling water. Fluff the couscous with a fork and stir in fresh herbs. Serve the salmon on a bed of couscous with asparagus on the side.

&#x200B;

**Coq au Vin Inspired Chicken Stew:**

Transform your pot into a rustic French-inspired chicken stew.

* Ingredients: Chicken thighs, red wine, pearl onions, mushrooms, carrots, chicken broth, bacon strips (optional), garlic, thyme, bay leaf, flour, butter, salt, and pepper.
* Instructions: In the pot, cook bacon until crispy. Remove and set aside. Brown chicken thighs in bacon fat. Remove chicken and saut√© pearl onions, mushrooms, and carrots until slightly caramelized. Add minced garlic and a sprinkle of flour. Stir to create a roux. Deglaze with red wine and let it reduce. Add chicken broth, thyme, and bay leaf. Return chicken and bacon to the pot. Simmer until chicken is tender and flavors meld.

&#x200B;

**Berry-Pecan Breakfast Quinoa:**

Start your day with a gourmet breakfast quinoa bowl.

* Ingredients: Quinoa, almond milk, mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries), toasted pecans, honey, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and a sprinkle of edible flowers (optional).
* Instructions: Cook quinoa in almond milk for added creaminess. Stir in vanilla extract and a pinch of nutmeg. Serve in bowls, topped with mixed berries, toasted pecans, a drizzle of honey, and edible flowers for a touch of elegance.

Live in Denver CO and am looking for a family camping vehicle. Not extreme off-roading, but definitely 4x4 and high clearance to get to trail heads and dispersed camping. No Subaru or other CVT.

* To get where we are going we often drive between 3 hours and 8-ish hours (depending on traffic). So a comfortable ride. Decent gas milage would be great, but I'm already willing to give on this.
* We have a newborn so safety is very important. LATCH for the car seat is also required.
* We also have a golden retriever and need some space for her. Also want enough space in the back for camping gear + baby gear. Likely 3-4 14 gal HDX boxes + 3-4 duffel bags plus some recovery gear, blankets, chairs, and pillows.
* Will most likely put a RTT on top, but leaning toward a SUV over truck to have the option to sleep in the back too.

The sun was already setting and there was no chance I could get back to town in time. So I just had to make do, figured I'd be fine. After it got dark and I was trying to close my eyes and I hear sumthing stomping around. Now that's not spooky but it was enough to keep me up longer. Then again I heard something stomping a little while later a lot closer to me then last time. Scared the shit outta me and got me wide awake for a few more hours. 
Now I'm chillin, it's 1:49 am about 2-3 hours tell sunrise and things get bright again and I've already encountered twice a bear growling noise. Realizing I can only pull the trigger once while holding the light in my other hand I'm determined to stay up till then.

I've wanted to go camping for a long time and it feels like I have the perfect opportunity now. 



I've become a lot more adventurous with my newfound freedom than I was during my school days. Been hiking and cliff jumping for a while now and spending a night outdoor is next on the list. 



My plan is still to go solo cause I can't find like minded people who are willing to spend as much money as I am on getting all the right camping gear.  The physical and psychological dangers of going alone don't scare me. I like the solitude. Solo hiked 20kms a day so I think i can make the trip.
 


The only problem I'm seeing is that I might be filling up my dorm room with way too much crap literally and also putting more than I can handle on my plate. I don't waste my time lazing around; I do have academic aspirations that I follow when I'm not thinking about all this. People go to college to focus on studies while I spent the entire sem thinking about all sorts of possible adventures to be had. Also, I got a pretty good GPA so not like I'm sabotaging myself in the academics area.

So I watch these survival shows, my favourite being Dual Survival and they tell you to be cautious of predatory animals out in the wild. I have also seen YouTube videos of people filming bear tramples the tent or lion going inside their camp or wolves spotted near campsites. That really scares me. So my question is, is it really safe camping in the wild? Campsites are different because they're built with a purpose, places where there are no wild animals. What about camping in the jungle? Like seriously deep in the jungle. Somewhere without people.",camping

913,1530304726.0,6 Reasons Why You Need To Take A Hammock When Travelling,"Many people are embracing the use of hammocks in their outdoor living and adventures. If you are yet to jump on this bandwagon, let me give you 6 reasons why you need to put a hammock in your backpack next time you are travelling.

**1.** **The absolute outdoor relaxation**

The hammock gives you a chance to relax outdoors. Using tree-friendly super straps, you can hang it on the beach and enjoy yourself without the bother of the sand getting into your clothes! A peaceful and relaxing nap when hiking in the woods simply requires a quiet place to hang your parachute hammock. 

**2.** **It has lots of uses**

The parachute nylon material that the camping hammock is made up of makes it a versatile item that you should always carry when travelling. It can come in handy wherever you may be. You can use it as a blanket, a picnic mat, a pillow, sunshade or even a backpack cover during light drizzles. 

**3.** **Offers cheaper accommodation**

Having a camping hammock is just like carrying a tent, only much better. Find yourself in a hotel or hostel with no more room? No worry, for a small fee you just need a small space to hang your hammock, and you are good to go! 

**4. much better sleep**

Sleep therapists and doctors advise one to sleep on their back for quality sleep. There is no other way other than this to sleep in a hammock. The gentle swinging of the hammock will relax you and before you know it you are soon asleep! Sleeping in a parachute hammock is also much more comfortable than in a sleeping bag on the hard ground. 

**5.** **Easily portable**

The parachute hammocks are lightweight and fit easily in a bag attached to it. This makes it very portable and can be carried everywhere. Compared to the bother of carrying a sleeping bag, you will love taking your hammock with you.

**6.** **Make friends easily**

The presence of a hammock surely attracts many people who want to try it out. A double-size hammock will give you a chance to make friends easily and have the joy of sharing with others. For hotel owners, hammocks are sure to pull people who would want to camp in your grounds.

Next time your adventure bug hits you, don‚Äôt forget to throw in your hammock in the car trunk. You never know when an opportunity will come calling for you to use it. You don‚Äôt want to miss that, do you?",camping

925,1696878716.0,Lost it on some neighboring campers (rant),"Went camping with the family this weekend (wife, 9 yr old daughter, and 7 yr old son).  Loved everything about the campsite and area, except for the inconsiderate neighbors we had.  Like most campsites, ours had a quite time policy from 10PM - 7AM.  The campsite next to ours had people from at least 3 other campsites gathered there.  Probably at least 10-12 people.  They never really made any effort to be quiet so we weren't surprised when 10:00 rolled around and they kept going as normal.  No music but just talking and laughing very loudly.  Even with earplugs in, they were still going strong at midnight and keeping us up when I finally decided to go say something in not the most polite of ways.  They did quiet down somewhat after that, but at that point I was so pissed I ended up getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep.  My wife and kids didn't fare much better either.  

The next day, between being already being sick and now deliriously exhausted I wasn't in the most tolerant of moods to say the least, nor feeling very kindly towards our inconsiderate neighbors.  As we're eating lunch, we watch them set up some stands that were about 5ft tall about 30 ft apart from each other on the gravel spot for where you would set tents up, put empty glass beer bottles on the stands then proceed to try to knock them off with a frisbee.  As anyone with a few functioning braincells could see happening, it didn't take long for one of the bottles to shatter after falling on the gravel.  Having cut my foot to the bone before on broken glass in a lake and not being able to walk right for months after, I'm a little touchy about people being careless with glass, so I went over said, ""Are y'all fucking retarded?  What are you thinking?  Did you not see that happening?""  (sorry for the ""R"" word).  Not the smartest approach, but I was exhausted, feeling horrible, not thinking straight and really just seeing red at that point like I haven't in many years.  One guy looked like he wanted to fight me, and the others weren't obviously happy about it either.  I typically keep a pretty level head in just about every situation but that was just the perfect storm to really send me over the edge.

I did go back and apologize for that, as I did feel bad for reacting like that but man, I'm just so sick of people being completely inconsiderate of others and careless about things.  The older I get the less patience I have for it.  Anyone who's ever shattered glass should also know there's no way you're ever going to get every last little piece of shattered glass out of gravel.  Even on a hardwood floor you need a vacuum cleaner to make sure you get up all the small pieces.  Sooner or later it's going to get turned up, go through someone's tent and into them.",camping

It seemed like a fun thing to do, and they're excited about it. Now that it's almost time to do (we are doing it this Friday night), I'm starting to think about the logistics of it and worrying myself a bit haha

With it being on the playset, we obviously can't do a tent, so I planned on just putting a pad down and sleeping in a tent under the stars. But I'm wondering how the dew and bugs will affect us. I live in Kentucky near the woods, for the record. The bugs currently are a pain during the day, but at dusk they seem to chill out, but I don't know if they will start bugging (excuse the pun) us after we stop moving, and not sure if bug spray alone will do the trick.

As far as dew goes, the ground definitely gets wet, but if we are elevated 5-10 feet (depending on which floor we are sleeping on), will that still be an issue? If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it. I want it to be fun, and I don't want my poor kids to wake up wet and full of bug bites!",camping

The trips I'm looking at would involve sightseeing in cities, taking public transportations in between, and few nights out in some national parks. I'm also carrying some photography gears including few lens and tripod.

It'd take a checked bag for flights to fit the gears. So far few criteria I figured out are: 

* Camera, lens and electronics will stay in a backpack with me, so no much need for the checked bag to provide protection for them.
* There should be wheels to make it easy to drag. With the use of public transportation (without driving a car), large backpack or duffle bag we be physically too demanding to move around.
* camp sites often require few or teens of minutes of walking on unpaved or gravel roads, so typical spinner luggage with tiny wheels wouldn't be easy to drag on those terrains.
* somewhat water resistant or even waterproof in case it rains when camping. I guess I could always wrap it with something for that.

Anyone in similar situation that'd share their solution for those?

* Sandbag Lunges: 3 sets x 10-12 reps

**Cardio**

* Hiking

We plan to go midweek in early may to aim to avoid school holidays. The Peak District is ideal because some of us are in Manchester and some are in Sheffield but I‚Äôm not dead set on it.

Some of the criteria were looking for in a campsite are:
Parking within a mile
A train station not too far away so we can do a trip or two to pick people up
Shower Facility‚Äôs aren‚Äôt necessary but would be very appreciated
W/C Facility‚Äôs
A nice country pub within a few miles
Woodland area is a big bonus but not essential

So if anyone has any recommendations or advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",camping

971,1675007113.0,Coleman stove stopped working,"We are extremely unhandy so please explain this to us like we are five.

Our Coleman stove is about 8 years old, I clean it but that's the only maintenance I have done. We use it about 30 days in the year.

Last Labour Day it stopped working, no gas is going in. I changed the propane so I know it's not that 

Is this fixable or do I buy a new one?",camping
972,1674647736.0,Good Secluded Spots Around DFW?,"Hello! I want to plan my first solo camping trip around the end of April, and I was wondering what some good places are to book. I live near Dallas, and I'm willing to drive as far as 4 hours out if need be.
I have gone camping before, but the sites were right next to each other no matter where I went, and I would like to find a place that's a little more spaced out. 
I would also like to note that I am a hammocker, so I would prefer forested areas to deserts or fields, but I'm not too picky if the sights are pretty and the hikes are nice. 

Also, any tips for a first time solo camper? 

Thanks in advance!",camping
973,1673217454.0,Summer 2023 camping on my own as a 17 year old male,"So hey, hello. I'm Rens and i want to go and camp in italy this summer all on my own.   
This idea came up last month and i decided it would be fun to be away from the fam for maybe 2 weeks. I want to buy an interrail ticket so i could go to italy and camp there.   


Is it forbidden to go wildcamping in Italy (i won't make a fire)

I am thinking about buying a 2 seconds tent with the sleeping stuff etc. Ehrmm yeah food to take with me and a good budget to buy food in local supermarkets. I also wanna take my road bike with me so i could go and visit places without spending alot of money. This because i like to live cheap and do new things in my (boring) life 

So long story short.   
What are the things a 17yr old male would need to go and camp on his own in Italy or country's/area's with mountains. 

What is like a money guideline i would need?

Have a nice evening for who have read this far. And hopefully u are able to help me, :)

975,1672858632.0,Dual Camping / Cabins near Denver?,"I'm planning on putting together a cousins reunion trip which stemmed from a few of us wanting to go camping near Denver. However, a good handful of additional cousins want to join us, but are not into camping. I've been trying to find cabins or houses to rent that are on a large property where some of us could camp (4) and some could stay in the house (6-8). But I'm really having a hard time finding something like this. Does anyone have any leads on a property that might work?

Thanks and happy camping!",camping
976,1671494174.0,Anyone want a Snow Peak H300 titanium double walled mug?,"I used this very nice mug for half a year but decided to deep clean it to remove some tea/coffee stains. Unfortunately I managed to tarnish the inside surface slightly by blow drying it with a hair dryer for under a minute after hand washing it. The tarnish itself doesn't bother me and isn't a health concern, but now there's a slight metallic smell/taste to it and I'm just going to get a new one. Tried boiling it with dish detergent/water, using baking soda/aluminum foil and it hasn't gone away completely. I'm willing to ship anywhere within CONUS for $20 or best offer net to me. PM for pics and a good place to ship.",camping

980,1697467044.0,How do you deal with liquid fuel stove smell ?,"Got an universal Whisperlite from MSR which i fill with unleaded fuel from the nearest gas pump I find when I land in a country.

For all the folks here who are into multi days hiking, what's your tips and tricks to keep your bag ""smell free"" as possible of unleaded fuel/ gasoline from your stove/ canister ?  


Edit: Just to be clear to everyone, I do travel a lot in very remote places around the world, finding white gas or taking it trough planes is really diffucult / impossible. That's why I fuel my bottle when I land in my destination country, usually with gasoline which is very easy to find.",camping
