1,1695942949.0,Finally Had First Unsafe Outdoors Experience,"Hey campers!

So...it finally happened. Bummer. 

I (usually a tent camper) rented an a-frame for a small, female-only family trip. Two female adults, two female kid/teens. 

I woke up at 3 am to hear what I think was footsteps outside our a-frame. Gahhhhh. I couldn't see out, but the possible intruder could see in because three sides of the a-frame were made of corrugated plastic. 

I was really scared, especially because I had my two beloved nieces and sister in there with me. 

I stayed inside and kept covered up, in hopes that the intruder would not be able to tell the gender or age of the people inside. 

I didn't pick up my cell to call for help,because I didn't want my face to be illuminated or my female voice to be heard. I also didn't have a way to give emergency responders directions to the a-frame since it was accessed via a path in the woods. 

I stayed awake and tried to breathe calmly, reminding myself that the sun would eventually be up and that MOST people do not get killed or attacked when camping. I also reminded myself that the person had not yet seen fit to attempt entering the structure. 

I'm not SURE it was a person out there. It was raining very hard, which sort of obscured the sound, but it really did sound like a human in hiking boots taking a few steps, pausing a while, and continuing to explore the site. This continued for 3.5 hours. 

We had no items of value, so nothing was taken. 

The a-frame was in the back of the owner's farm, so it wasn't another camper at a neighboring site. 

I mentioned this to the owner, and she didn't explain it away as an animal or anything, like ""Oh there are tons of deer. They walk around at night."" She did say she would look around for footprints and that the day after we left, they found a dead/attacked duck on the property. 

I felt so oddly defenseless in there. Any other campers experience this? I would love any safety tips or insight. I

I'll definitely force myself to stay outside again SOON, but I'm definitely open to any tips on how I could have been better prepared to handle this, especially as a female camper. 

Thanks, fellow campers!",camping
2,1697593804.0,Big Bear Car Camping Mid-November (SoCal),"Hi all, we just had to postpone our semi-annual TransCat backpacking trip because our friend who is coming to visit/camp/hike hurt his back. So instead, instead we're looking for options to car camp for a couple of nights while he's here mid-November (weekend before Thanksgiving, I know). We live in SD and we've camped many places in SoCal - and I'd love to go to spot we haven't camped before + within a couple of hours' drive. Of course most of our normal favorite spots in the region are booked at this point (Refugio, Laguna, Palomar, JT, etc.) but I've found an option up at Big Bear Lake. 

I know it's difficult to say that time of year, but does this feel too late season to camp up there temperature-wise? Majority of the sites at the campground are reserved, so others are clearly ok with it. I've camped in Idyllwild this time of year and perfectly fine, but that's not on the water like Big Bear is. My fiance and I will sleep in our car / tent set up so we'll be fine, but our friend (from a very warm weather country) will be in a regular tent (I'll give him our best insulation/sleeping pads) so wanted a gut check - are we pushing it too late in the season for good chances to camp up there comfortably, sans any early winter weather? Thanks in advance. ",camping

5,1697587883.0,So nostalgic,"Let me start by saying that we're planning our first camping trip as a family with 3 young kids (4,5,6yo). I've been trying to plan everything out, cooking, extra curriculars, how were gonna keep them busy, the whole 9. Ive been trying to decide between getting a Blackstone, a propane stove, or just trying to cook everything over fire. I came across this on Marketplace and a sense of nostalgia came over me. It brought he back to the days of the boyscouts. It just made sense. No disposable propane tanks and I can make use of my extensive cast iron collection. The guy I got it from said the tank wouldn't pressurize, and he was right. I saw some posts on here about massaging the leather pump gasket with some oil, and let me tell you, it worked like a charm! Fired right up! I was concerned that this thing wouldn't heat up my cast iron fast enough, but boy was I wrong. Put my pan on, went inside to get some eggs and butter up some bread, by the time I got back out my pan was smoking like crazy! Needless to say, I believe our new stove will serve us well and aid in many memories to come!

13,1697568896.0,"Greater Toronto Area, Crown Land camping?","I live in the centre of york region in the Greater Toronto Area, been looking to find a place nearby for camping, not looking for any place extraordinary, just want to do general camping so I can learn, and have good time with some bros. Most provincial parks around me don't allow camping or are closed for the season already, plus I'd rather not have to pay. I've gone camping before, but only in provincial park campgrounds.

I used the crown land atlas map to look for crown land nearby, and there definitely is crown land around in southern Ontario, even in the GTA , though obviously they're not as big areas as in northern Ontario. But they're just 40 mins drive away from me, so it'd be perfect if I want to camp a night whenever I want.

An issue I found though is that these patches of General Use Area are usually surrounded by private land, either residential areas or farms, so I don't know how to get there without trespassing, sometimes there's dirt roads, but I think they're private roads for the farms, sometimes theres rivers running by them so theoretically you could just take a canoe there but its really inconvenient. If you guys have any information, I'd appreciate it, but I'm thinking I'll forget about these spots.

I did find another good area thats designated as a Provincial Wildlife Area on the map, and on the policy report it says Crown Land Recreation is permitted, so I guess I could camp there, its a relatively larger area, and theres a river running across it, theres also roads that go across. The only issue I have here is where to park my car, its mostly just farms around the area, but there are roads with wide gravel shoulders, could I just park it there, and then hike into the forest?",camping

26,1697539104.0,Wilderness camping with kids,"Edit: You all have been phenomenally helpful. It turns out what I want to do is called dispersed camping, and I now know that is not the same thing as wilderness camping. Lol. I've also learned there are plenty of camp sites tucked out of the way back in the woods that you can drive right up to, which I did not know, so that is the plan at least for the first trip or two, possibly for all trips until my kids are a bit older. Someone had a great suggestion to take them day hiking with their little backpacks in the area I want to camp, so that's on the list, and will also be used to scout out decent sites. üòÅ


Edit 2:
A few clarifications;

1) I meant a mile or two from a more populated area such as a designated camp site. I would be maybe a few hundred feet off the trail, and I'm unsure from the road until I go scope camp spots. The mile or two from a more populated  area was just with the idea if my kid falls in poop and absolutely must wash off in a water pump or something. The kinds of situations you don't really know if it might happen until your kids have been on a few camping trips and know how to act carefully. However, as mentioned in edit 1, I've learned there are places you can drive right up to a dispersed camping spot.

2) The first several trips will be in groups with family and friends. I didn't mention that because it wasn't relevant to the questions I'm asking, like what gear I need, and also because I want to plan way ahead for when I am comfortable going with just my kids. The first trip would likely be 5-7 adults and 4-11 kids, with my 2 being the youngest, several technically adults, but kids of the family.

3) It's completely accurate that I don't know what kinds of things I need to plan for, which is why I'm asking 5-6 months before I plan on taking the first camping trip like this, probably around March or April. I can spend those 5-6 months doing things like taking an emergency first aid class, even though one of my planned camping partners is a nurse, so I can be better prepared for when I do decide to camp alone with my kids. A lot of y'all are responding like I'm packing up to go get lost in the deep forest tomorrow with 2 kids and no planning or anything. Lol.

4) Their dad is not involved in a way that could be helpful for my kids to have experiences like this, so it's 100% on me to do that with no help. I will always try to give them good experiences, obviously in a safe way with months of planning for higher risk activities.


Original post:
I'm looking at taking my kids (4 and 5 years old) camping at Hoosier National Forest in Indiana next spring/summer. I have all the basic camping gear, but have only camped at a tent site. My son was very disappointed we weren't in the woods. I plan to camp within a mile or two of a recreation area or a tent site, just in case anything were to happen with 2 little kids, I don't want to be wayyy out away from civilization. My kids just did a 5 mile hike, and told me ""that wasn't even a hike, it was just a walk"" so I know 1-2 miles would be fine for them. All that being said, I've never been wilderness camping, and am wondering if I need extra gear (besides some sort of restroom facilities), than what I would need at a tent site?

Also, for anyone familiar with Hoosier National specifically, what kind of critters do I need to watch out for? My area really has nothing particularly concerning... coyotes, raccoons, foxes. No bears, no venomous snakes, nothing that really has a good chance of taking you out, so just wondering what I'd need to keep an eye out for there?

Lastly, any tips for camping with kids that age are appreciated. We had a really awesome weekend last time camping, so I don't expect issues, but we'll probably do a longer trip to Hoosier National.

Oh, and final question, our dog will be coming too, so tips for extended camping with her. Obviously food, water, bowls, leash, treats, tieout. She sleeps in the tent with us, so no separate bed. I do have a tick key (for her & us), but anything I may not be thinking of?",camping
27,1697525221.0,"R-value testing of cardboard, various blankets, etc.?","Does anyone know of any R-value testing done on cardboard, blankets, and other things you might be able to easily find at home, especially using the ASTM F3340-18 standard? Ground pads are cheap but I'm thinking if a new camper just wants to grab whatever they happen to have at home to get out into somewhat cold weather, how much and what should I tell them to grab? I'm sure a big enough pile of blankets would eventually reach any desired R-value but I'd love to be able to provide some guidelines as to how much and what types of common at-home blankets would best, although less compactable blankets intuitively seem to make the most sense.

I'm thinking particularly in terms of scouting, when a scout might invite a non-camper friend on a trip whose parents aren't ready to start spending money on the scout's gear but we certainly wouldn't want them to have a miserable night of sleep.

I understand chemical by-products released from burning things such as plastic outside of the proper facilities, but is my one weekend of camping really affecting things?

Edit: I appreciate the replies, even the ones that come off as condescending. To clarify a couple of things:

I was raised in the woods far removed from civilization. I have a healthy respect for nature and preserving it. The fact that I‚Äôm asking the question and wanting to improve my understanding/practices should somewhat reflect that. 

The camping I‚Äôm referring to is at a public campground in the center of my city. It has a dedicated fire pit. It‚Äôs not backcountry or very remote. I can drive my car 3 minutes and be in the nearest neighborhood.

I agree with anyone who says the mentality of ‚Äúwhat I do doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù is a bad state of mind.

120,1697223577.0,New California campsite reservation law,"Finally, a good step in the right direction for the California campground reservation system.

""You could be banned from California campgrounds for bailing on your campsite reservation"" 

""A new bill signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsome aims to deter no-shows, including banning repeat offenders.

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan introduced Assembly Bill 618. It makes several changes to how California State Parks (CSP) will handle camping reservations.

The law states that campers must cancel their booking seven days before arrival. Those who don‚Äôt will lose their reservation fee, the cost of the first night‚Äôs stay and will incur an $8 cancellation fee. If campers don‚Äôt show up by the day after their reservation date, the CSP will cancel the remaining days on their reservation. If a camper is a no-show three or more times in a calendar year, CSP can ban them from making new reservations.

To make it easier for campers to make reservations, the law makes campsites more available by limiting the number of days people can stay at the same campsite in a year to 30 and limits the length of reservations during peak season to seven consecutive nights. The bill will also implement a lottery system by 2025 for five of the most popular park campsites, to be determined by the CSP based on advanced booking interest.

The new laws take effect January 1, 2024""

I recently had a group see me alone and bring me food. I had already had dinner and politely explained and declined. But later a member of the group brought me food and started small talking. Me being kind, sitting here full on my own dinner. Looking at a plate of food as a talk feeling rude for not stuffing my self to no end. ",camping

To go down my gear list....  
New TeePee tent that I can setup solo, has enough room for a new cot (thanks to the wife) and my gear, and a chair. I also picked up a tarp to put under it because it doesn't a heavy floor. It does have a rainfly and what I'm calling a witches hat that goes on top.  
Gas camping stove, compact cookware, 2.6 gallons of water, Yeti of food, hand warmer, lights and a table. I'm hoping the campground will have dry wood and I'm picking up long burning logs just to be safe but its possible I won't have a fire for heat. I am bringing clothes to keep me warm and extra socks.

I'm picking up some wash in water repellent treatment for my raincoat and pants plus a poncho to be on the safe side. So I'm going into this planning on being wet and cold (40's-50's). I don't have an electric site but I'm hoping with the weather people will cancel and I can get one of theirs because the grounds are fully booked.

Currently the only good idea i have would be a cot tent (cot with a tent built in). Weight and size when folded in does not really matter since i won't hike long distances with it and it gets me off the ground.

A hammock is not really viable since trees are rare on festival camping grounds, and to sleep in the car you often have to pay for a separate caravan/mobile home/campervan ticket and camping ground. A regular tent with a cot in it would get me off the ground but the tent would still get dirty.

This taught us the importance of being prepared. We had to administer first aid, improvise a splint from materials at hand, and carefully help the injured member back to camp. It underscored the value of having basic medical skills and an emergency plan.

In addition, we encountered a heavy rainstorm that lasted for two days, testing our gear and resolve. Our tent developed a small leak, which we had to patch with a repair kit we had brought. We also learned how crucial it is to properly secure food to prevent encounters with wildlife like bears.

This experience was a stark reminder of the unpredictability of the wilderness and the necessity of thorough planning and preparedness.

153,1697090043.0,Have you had any scary or life-threatening experiences while camping?,"Back in 2021 my husband and I were camping in Wyoming at the Boysen Reservoir. We got really lucky and were able to book a ‚Äúbeach‚Äù front site, directly leading to the water but the downside was that it was very, very far away from the other campsites. We were essentially isolated from everyone else, at the time though it sounded like a dream come true. 

The thing about Wyoming is that it‚Äôs so desolate to the point where it‚Äôs pitch black and eerily dead silent once the sun is gone. We set up our camp, enjoyed our fire, but shortly after that, a random SUV with blacked out windows came driving down our road and into our site. 

They drove towards us, my husband tried to wave to them in case they were lost and needed help, but instead they ignored us and drove down to the beach, stayed there for 5 minutes, turned around and went back up the way they came. 

We immediately got a bad vibe, my husband told me to throw everything in the car and he kept shining a flashlight towards the beach because we had a feeling they dropped someone off to watch us. After we packed up we got in the car and hauled ass. Lo and behold, the same car drove back into our campsite and when they saw us leaving, they actually started chasing us. Mind you, the roads in Wyoming are bumpy and unkept when you‚Äôre in the wilderness- on top of that, enormous wildlife that wanders in and out of the streets. My husband said ‚ÄúI have to go fast, are you ok with that?‚Äù And I said ‚Äújust go and get us out of here.‚Äù 

We were easily going 80mph down these windy roads and even through a canyon, they were on our tail for about 10 mins until we lost them after passing through the canyon. Most terrifying experience of our lives, we think about it to this day and wonder what could‚Äôve happened if we didn‚Äôt listen to our gut at that moment.

Edit: wow! I had no idea this would blow up. To those who shared their stories and experiences like this post was intended for, thank you. 
To those who made it a debate about guns, you do you- but I want to live, and not be ignorant to the fact that dangerous people do, in fact, exist. 

And to those who claimed I‚Äôm either lying or paranoid- for one, we tried to engage with them, but these folk barreled past us without a word. First red flag. Two, our site was so isolated, why would anyone pull up to our campsite just to sit at the beach for a few minutes and then leave? You can‚Äôt drive across the sand to the other campsites because of the water, so if you‚Äôre coming to our site, you‚Äôre doing it for a reason. Second red flag. We were chased by them for miles after we started leaving, so it‚Äôs pretty self explanatory at that point. Boom, suspicions confirmed. üôÑ  thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",camping

Two weeks in a tent in the Florida Keys in October. Hot (95+ degrees) and very humid. My wife and I are at a camp site with her parents, our 9 year old daughter who is nonverbal autistic & 18 month old son.

My wife's family used to camp regularly, but I do not. Her parents and my daughter are in an RV, with my wife, son, and I in a tent that we discovered leaks.

203,1696945394.0,"My Camping Experience at Big Meadows, Shenandoah","My area was quiet by 9:45pm. The loudest sounds throughout the day were the sounds of children laughing. I forgot to bring a hatchet, so I asked my neighbor if i could borrow his. He was really nice about it.

That's about it. There was no amplified music. I didn't hear any generators. There were no drunken arguments. Honestly, the most exciting thing was a couple deer that passed by.

I don't know if y'all were hoping for some horror story or something; I know Reddit loves drama. Sometimes all that drama is exhausting. Sometimes, you just want to camp in a national park, and see a bunch of stars at night. We saw a ton of stars. The only real negative thing was the price of firewood.

Big Meadows is great. It has a ton of facilities. The meadows are in fact, big. It's near a bunch of cool trails. I get that Shenandoah ain't no Yosemite or even Acadia, but for a lot of people, it's fairly close to where they live.

Some caveats:

* Big Meadows campground is huge. There could have a bunch of loud drunken people blasting music in some other section, who knows.
* It did get down to the mid 30s. Maybe the kind of people who get really wild are the type who can't handle the cold.
* Big Meadows is basically fully booked all the time. You're not gonna walk-in with your stuff
* We camped during the holiday weekend.",camping

Two weeks in a tent in the Florida Keys in October. Hot (95+ degrees) and very humid. My wife and I are at a camp site with her parents, our 9 year old daughter who is nonverbal autistic & 18 month old son.

My wife's family used to camp regularly, but I do not. Her parents and my daughter are in an RV, with my wife, son, and I in a tent that we discovered leaks.

I'm constantly covered in a glaze of my own sweat and being eaten alive by mosquitoes and noseeums. I *want* to like camping, but this is pure misery. My mood is making me miserable to be around and I feel like I'm ruining it for everyone.

General or specific advice on what I can do to make a better experience for myself (and by extension, my family).

UPDATE:: We're leaving in two days, though I'm pushing hard to leave tomorrow. It's a two day drive. Also, it rained its ass off last night and we do not appear to have any leaks. Thank God for small miracles. I'm not beaten yet!",camping

I usually camp in the Sierras, but since it'll be too cold up there in November we wanted to camp somewhere along the coast. But none of us are very familiar at all with options out there. 

We want to car camp since not all of us have gear for backpacking. It can be a dirt road but not too far or bumpy. Something that will have decent spaces available about a month in advance. We also want to do a campfire, so we don't want anywhere with fire restrictions. We all have sleeping bags down to at least 35F so I believe temp shouldn't be a problem on the coast.

223,1696878716.0,Lost it on some neighboring campers (rant),"Went camping with the family this weekend (wife, 9 yr old daughter, and 7 yr old son).  Loved everything about the campsite and area, except for the inconsiderate neighbors we had.  Like most campsites, ours had a quite time policy from 10PM - 7AM.  The campsite next to ours had people from at least 3 other campsites gathered there.  Probably at least 10-12 people.  They never really made any effort to be quiet so we weren't surprised when 10:00 rolled around and they kept going as normal.  No music but just talking and laughing very loudly.  Even with earplugs in, they were still going strong at midnight and keeping us up when I finally decided to go say something in not the most polite of ways.  They did quiet down somewhat after that, but at that point I was so pissed I ended up getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep.  My wife and kids didn't fare much better either.  

The next day, between being already being sick and now deliriously exhausted I wasn't in the most tolerant of moods to say the least, nor feeling very kindly towards our inconsiderate neighbors.  As we're eating lunch, we watch them set up some stands that were about 5ft tall about 30 ft apart from each other on the gravel spot for where you would set tents up, put empty glass beer bottles on the stands then proceed to try to knock them off with a frisbee.  As anyone with a few functioning braincells could see happening, it didn't take long for one of the bottles to shatter after falling on the gravel.  Having cut my foot to the bone before on broken glass in a lake and not being able to walk right for months after, I'm a little touchy about people being careless with glass, so I went over said, ""Are y'all fucking retarded?  What are you thinking?  Did you not see that happening?""  (sorry for the ""R"" word).  Not the smartest approach, but I was exhausted, feeling horrible, not thinking straight and really just seeing red at that point like I haven't in many years.  One guy looked like he wanted to fight me, and the others weren't obviously happy about it either.  I typically keep a pretty level head in just about every situation but that was just the perfect storm to really send me over the edge.

I did go back and apologize for that, as I did feel bad for reacting like that but man, I'm just so sick of people being completely inconsiderate of others and careless about things.  The older I get the less patience I have for it.  Anyone who's ever shattered glass should also know there's no way you're ever going to get every last little piece of shattered glass out of gravel.  Even on a hardwood floor you need a vacuum cleaner to make sure you get up all the small pieces.  Sooner or later it's going to get turned up, go through someone's tent and into them.",camping

Here is the problem, I don't have a tent and money is tight. The budget for the trip all in has to be $500CDN between the two of us. The tent has to fit two large men and keep out the worst of the chill. We both have great sleeping bags and sleeping mats. 

I'm going to be spending $40 on wood. I know a place where I can fill my trunk for that amount, good for the 2 nights we plan to spend. I want to keep food and drinks around $75. The less we spend on food the more we can spend on fun. It'll be at least $30 for gas. I'm going to need propane for the stove so that's another $25. Other than that, all of my gear is in good condition. I have extra blankets, clothes and the like to keep warm.

All said, I'm looking at $170CDN in non-negotiable purchases. That leaves $330 for a tent. 

Blessedly, the campsite is a free provincial site up a gravel road. No expenses there.

As far as food is concerned, we're good with eating rice and canned goods for the trip. 

Any help with the budget or recommendations for a decent tent will be much appreciated! 

As far as entertainment, we plan to fish, read, play board games, and listen to music.

296,1696606716.0,Better Hot Water solution for group camping!,"I'll start off by saying I'm an engineer and love solving problems with technical solution, even if there really isn't a ""problem"" to begin with - but if you'll indulge me, I think many folks here will enjoy the discussion and ideas.

Most of my camping is now focused on groups of 20+ people due to my son being in Cub Scouts. It's entirely car-camping based but we often do 2-night campouts. 

The ""problem"" is that kids LOVE hot cocoa, and adults like myself sure enjoy coffee and being able to wash utensils with warm water.

As seen in the attached picture, we have taken to using the orange Igloo drink cooler as a hot water on-tap source. People can make their own tea, coffee, or hot cocoa as desired without having to heat an individual serving.

We heat the water with a propane burner and stock pot, which means we have to pick up a boiling pot and dump it into the cooler periodically. It works, but it's less convenient and I feel like only a matter of time before someone has an accident and douses their feet or legs with 2 gallons of scalding water.

But we're now all accustomed to hot water on demand, so I'm wondering if other people have suggestions, even if I have to make them myself?

Ideally, this solution would be :

1) Propane fired
2) Big enough to hold at least 2 gallons of water hot enough to brew coffee .
3) Insulated so as not to constantly burning fuel.
4) Not require electricity, or running water/water pressure.
5) Not involve manual transfer of boiling water from heater to insulated container 

The best thought I can come up with is using a similar beverage cooler with a coil of copper tubing in an external 'chimney' over a propane burner, that would result in convection circulation. 
But I'm curious if anyone else has ideas. Thanks!",camping

300,1696582243.0,I just returned from my first solo trip and it was magical!,"6 years ago when I moved to Oz I had never been camping and when my husband brought it up my reaction was,  ""We're going to sleep outside? Why?"" But his family are big campers and it didn't take long to get me to go along. 
 
I have been really run down lately. Work stress, plus I gave up all my leave last year to do end of life care for my husbands grandfather overseas so I haven't had a proper break from work in 2 years.  I had a little leave saved up and I really wanted to so something by myself which my husband fully supported. 

We are lucky to live in the most beautiful place in the entire world, so I don't need to travel far to experience natural beauty.  I chose a camp ground 90 minutes from home because I was familiar with it, and it has full mobile reception which I felt was important on my first trip alone. 

My tent is absolutely enormous because we invested in the oztrail 10 person during the Christmas sales and I don't have a smaller one. It was actually relatively easy to set up on my own! I wanted a bit a glamping feel so I brought along my bedding and a few pretty bits from home.  

The best parts of this site for me are the rock slides, (like a naturally formed waterslide) which I spent an entire morning gleefully riding, and also the rock wallabies. There is a rare species of wallaby that only lives in this small region, and this particular colony is friendly to humans and you can hand feed them. The mothers with joeys are usually more reserved but I went out at dusk and had an incredible interaction with a mama who let me stroke her baby in her pouch while she ate out of my hand!

318,1696478875.0,How do you FIREPIT?,"My friends and I, we camp all year including in the rain and snow. In bad weather we sit under a tarp.

But there is a problem with sheltering under a tarp and placing the fire OUTSIDE the tarp (which you must do if you like your tarp). The problem is that a circular fire will only warm the 2-3 people who are sitting at the edge of the tarp close to the fire.So, we built a hearth about 5-6 feet wide, alongside the edge of the tarp. We stacked the rocks high at the back and left the front open. The ends of the wall curve inward but then open up to allow more heat to reflect at the ends. It works amazingly. Of course it does require a fair bit of wood because the fire is pretty wide. (See pic)

Another thing we tried recently was to build a platform of stones (about 1 foot high) and then we put our fire on top of the platform. It wasn't a very cold night and it was dry, so we didn't need to think about insulating the heat, etc. This made the fire a little more interactive; the edges of the platform were like a countertop where we could place our foil-wrapped snacks, etc. Also, one corner of the platform was a pretty acute angle, like a spur of stone that you could stand over, with feet on either side, to get REALLY warm.

What have you done to maximize the effectiveness of your hearth build?

We were in Hoosier National Forest, and had an alarm set for 4:30 to start looking for a good site by 5 to give us enough plenty of time to set up camp.

 I am guessing that they are used in the US? 

Can someone define them through descriptions? 

For context, I am Canadian, and these are some terms I use.. (disclaimer there are probably others we use in Canada that I have missed). 

1. Backpacking: Hiking camping while on a trail. Campsites may be designated or not (just a good spot). The land is either a park (Provincial or Federal), or public (Crown).  There is never a picnic table. There might be a tent pad, outhouse, bear box. 

2. Canoe,kayak or bike packing - similar to 1 but on water or by bike. 

3. Car camping: Driving to a designated campground that has designated individual sites. People camp in tents, or may take trailers, RVs or truck & camper combos. 
a) The majority are public: either in parks (provincial or Federal) or around logging leases. Amenities are basic: maybe a few drinking water taps throughout the campground, outhouse toilets, no power or water hook ups. The individual site has a picnic table and fire ring; sometimes a bear box. 
b) There are privately owned ones that have fancier amenities like water and power at each site, buildings with flush toilets and showers.  Sometimes there is a pool and clubhouse. The individual site has at minimum a picnic table and fire ring (to start). 
 
4. Boondocking: Driving out into the bush on a logging or resource road and finding a spot to pull over and camp at. The land is public (crown, or under a logging lease).  Boondockers where I live often seem more likely to have vans or a truck & camper set up than use tents.",camping

Henry Miller said that if we are always arriving and departing, it is also true that we are eternally anchored, that one's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things. I return to his writing often in life, but thought about him constantly while cycling the Pacific Coast again. His library in Big Sur was the destination for my first cross-country bike tour ten years ago, but again a precious checkpoint here and now after traveling thousands of miles from the Arctic Ocean to this journey‚Äôs dewy, doughy center.

The hardest days collected en route seem to linger with paralytic hypnosis.

Because we are planning on extensive hiking and exploring the forest on FS roads, I wanted some good physical maps. I was planning on picking them up at the ranger station in person, but I have a feeling they will be closed. The USGS store \*is\* an option for a topo, but I have little faith in the speed of their shipping and whether the order will be actually processed in time, and they don't have motor vehicle use maps.

Is this something I should worry about? I assume FS offices will be closed during the shutdown - is anyone aware of other sources of maps? Hoping for the motor vehicle use maps and topos. I have many digital maps but I feel iffy about relying on my phone or ipad. ",camping

How do I store these?

Will the can get hot when I use it?  
Do I have to put out the fire somehow before I turn off the gas, or can I put out the fire by turning off the gas?  

I assume I screw the attachment on: how tight do I screw?

515,1695813577.0,[UK Camping Q] - Government Law or Campsite Law?,"Just to preface this question, its not a caravan/ car camping question per say...  


TL:DR Why are people sleeping in cars 'banned' at campsites?

Hi all,

A group of us are off camping in the Peak District next week, 3 of us are regular campers, but our driver, whilst a competent outdoors person, does not have a tent and would like to sleep in the back of their car (not a van/ caravan etc).

The campsite we are staying at says we can leave the car next to where our tents are pitched, but its strictly prohibited to sleep in the car, even though everyone is paying the full price, per person, per tent, per car etc.

I've never been in a position of needing to know the answer to this, as although I usually have my car, I've always camped in a tent...

However, the campsite owner doesn't seem to have a valid reason as to why this is not allowed AND when I have looked at alterative campsites in the area, they all suggest that its not allowed BUT won't give a satisfactory reason as to why not :/

Is there a reason?

I can only surmise that 'maybe' it has something to do with keeping the engine on? My friend has an EV, but I guess its a blanket ban no exceptions, IF indeed that is the reason? But why not just be transparent about why not?

530,1695759838.0,"Didn't open new Core tent right away, it's broken, what to do with it now?"," I  am heartbroken. Saved since May for a dream Core 9 Person Instant tent.  Ordered it in August from Amazon (my first mistake in this story I  guess), hoping to be ready for when the Fall weather hit.

Stupid me - I did not set up the tent at home. I am very familiar with these Core tents and didn't anticipate any issues.

Well,  I took it on a state park trip 2 weekends ago and right out of the bag  it was broken. Three of the upper poles that connect to the side hubs  are split from end to end and one of the poles was backward (the  pushbutton side facing inward). It wouldn't stand, because the way one  of the poles was ""wonky"" in the side hub. It took the help of many  fellow campers as well as a DNR employee to get the tent to  stand...precariously. At one point we had it rigged with twine to tree  branches up above lol. It was either that or just pack up and go home,  wasting vacation days.

As soon as I  got home I emailed Core about the issue. Adding to my heartbreak, as I  worried would happen, I am out of luck. They told me sorry and to return  to Amazon, but it is past the 30 day return window for that. I'm beyond  frustrated (mostly with myself!).

What  can I do with this tent? I do not want it, will never use it again as I  can't trust it to take camping. I am an older solo camper (with dog)  that can't chance getting somewhere and not being able to set up. Lesson  learned, go with a single-hub tent to lessen chance of issues/easier to  prop up and solve if a hub doesn't work (and lesson learned, set up a  tent the second you get it). I had really wanted this larger tent for  myself so that on rainy days I could have a lot of room to hang out -  but I'm glad at least I wasn't several states from home. Now I know to  stick to a tent I can manage myself should something happen. I know you  can order poles and hubs, but at this point I am not interested in  fixing it (like I said, will never trust a multi-hub now) and I don't  have time to be trying to mess with taking something like this apart.

Anyway  - I don't do Facebook, ebay or any of that sort of stuff to try and  sell it and don't know anyone who would want it, as it's technically  broken. Shipping it would probably cost a small fortune even if I wanted  to give it away online. What would be the best way for me to maybe  donate it somewhere (with the caveat that it's broken and someone handy  would have to fix it first)? I hate to just put it out in my trash,  because I'm sure someone mechanically inclined could fix it up. It's a  beautiful tent (if it worked). Advice?

I'm somewhat ok with it being large, I can put it in a cooler during transport and store other items in it. But in particular I want it to be lightweight, and safe to put over a fire.

I don't like mummy bags, and I'm not interested in quilts. I've tried both, and neither is for me.

I'm after a bag intended for comfort in 30-40¬∞ overnight temps, so I'm guessing a 0¬∞ or -10¬∞F survival rating?

I sleep cold and I doubt I'll be camping much once the overnight temps are in the low-30s, but upper-20s is also possible. Yes, I layer up and I'm not in any danger in that regard. I have a decent down bag from REI (house-brand), but it's made for tall people, not wide people, and there's just too much space beneath my feet, but due to my shoulder width and waist size, side sleeping is an issue.

&#x200B;

What I've done so far... I loaded each with pillows and weights so each bag is roughly 28lbs. I simulated weight for my gear. I checked that both were comfortable and that I could fit each pack where I have 80% weight on my back and 20% on my shoulders. I walked around for 10 mins with each bag and went up and down stairs.

&#x200B;

So far I know I like both color ways and they're both comfortable from the short testing. I like that the Crown2 is roomier and lighter. I like that the Decathlon has thicker waist bands and shoulder straps. That's not really enough for me to decide yet.",camping

609,1695482559.0,Pop-up tent for early October camping in the UK?," 

Hi all, I'm really excited about planning my first solo camping trip for early October and had a few questions. I'm really excited to get out there and experience nature firsthand. I only have a 3-4 person pop-up tent - would that be suitable for the conditions then, or is there too much risk of rain/wind?

As a first-time solo camper accessing sites by public transport/a short taxi, I don't mind having to change trains a couple of times, but going from bus to train to bus to train isn't really what I'm looking for. What spots would you recommend that are doable without a car? It would also be nice if there was a pub or small restaurant nearby in case the weather gets too bad - I know, I know, having a backup warm meal option is ""half ass camping"" for you veterans out there, but hey, it's my first time so cut me some slack! I'd love to find a more remote wooded area if possible for the full camping experience, including hopefully getting to warm up around a little fire in the evenings and enjoying the beauty of it getting dark early, settling into my tent with a good book while listening to the sounds of the woods. Nothing like warming up over a little fire, ey?

Additionally, as an inexperienced camper, are there any small, low-cost items I should bring that could make a big difference in comfort? I'm planning on really bundling up in my sleeping bag, but open to any other tips.

With budget and size being a consideration when using public transit, any advice on items that should be prioritised or deprioritised in my packing based on typical October weather?

Lastly, how likely is it I'd run into other campers that late/early in the season? I don't mind being somewhat secluded, but it would be nice to have others nearby just in case. I'm also curious about the rules around extending stays if enjoying my first trip. Like hypothetically, since i know farmers don't really care if you wild camp on their land, would the manager/staff approach me to leave if I overstayed my pitch by a day or two?

Any advice from any level of camping expierience is greatly appreciated! I'm determined to get out there via public transport, but I want to plan carefully since I'm new to camping solo. Let me know your thoughts!

He ended up giving me a substantial discount but asked me to pick it up from their warehouse, conveniently located nearby. Once I got back home, I wasted no time setting up the RTT. I then took my son on a two-day adventure to West Virginia to give it a test run. I must say, it exceeded my expectations overall.

Next up, I'm planning a solo camping trip for approximately a month. During this extended camping adventure, I realized that I might need to conduct some additional tests and preparations. I'm eager to learn what steps to take to ensure the RTT's reliability and my safety in this situation. I'm also contemplating whether I need to stock up on specific equipment or resources to handle various potential challenges.

613,1695460216.0,Thank you for not being these campers. Seriously.,"Hey all you beautiful campers! I wanted to say thank you to all of the amazing people on here who are fabulous at sharing the outdoors with others. We just got back from 1 week at our favorite local state campground we go to instead of therapy. I feel like I need therapy now because of it.

It's finally the time of year you can be one of the only people in campgrounds here. I made reservations a few months ago, which everyone can see online when campsites are taken on what dates, right?

Enjoying the peaceful forest, we're the only ones there for a week, out of 60 sites. What a stellar week! But NO...a family of screaming kids has to pull in RIGHT NEXT TO US.  Can anyone tell me why people do this? I have the same reaction when I'm in an empty restaurant and someone comes in and sits right next to me. Maybe I need to be less introverted.

Anyway, while one kid is carrying a Bluetooth speaker and blasting music at 5 million decibels right next to our car in our site, another one starts hacking at the old oak trees with a machete....and then starts chasing squirrels with it while screaming. And then starts eyeing our two little dogs. I asked the parents as nicely as possible to put their wild primates in check, and they told me to go fuck myself. When the kids started throwing gravel at our car and the ""adults"" thought it was cute while they threw another beer can in the bushes, I called the ranger. They actually kicked them out double time. But we ended up leaving that evening because they knew where we were, and I'm feeling paranoid.

So, to all of you pleasant, ettiquette-minding campers, a great big THANK YOU.

Edit: Thanks everyone for making me feel like I'm not hypercritical :D. I should also add that they didn't have a reservation (I checked the website too) but they drove around and looked at all the sites first. We always keep our dogs quiet and set up a dog fence around our seating area as well, don't play music etc. I was half joking about camping for therapy...but we are both first responders and quiet camping time is really important, which is why when we go to actual campgrounds we go in the off season or check the availability maps.

I am looking at buying a tent (specifically the CORE Equipment 10 Person Lighted Instant Cabin Tent with Awning from Costco). It comes with a plug. What would I plug into? An outlet at a camp ground? My vehicle all day? 

I used to camp a lot but never had a tent with a plug. Confused when it would come in use.

616,1695436873.0,What are some cool / funny / otherwise positive or uplifting stories you have from camping?,"Feels like this subreddit has been a hotbed of straight up negativity recently with all of the etiquette arguments and whatnot so lets flip the script.  What are some really nice/friendly/wholesome experiences you've had with your neighbors and fellow campers over the years?

tldr: old lady recently widow(er?)ed is nice to us and everyone has a nice experience

I have a ton but one that always sticks in my mind despite being well over 20 years ago was camping at a little campground in WNC by a river.  Pit toilet, not a lot of sites, pretty out of the way in a national forest.  I was probably like 10 or 11 at the time and when we showed up there was nobody else there at all. We took a really sweet site by the river and got situated etc.

A few hours later a probably 70+ old lady with a little 80s pop up camper trailer and extremely nice sweet old grandma energy shows up and pulls up by our site and in a totally non grumpy way exclaims ""yall took my favorite spot!"" which makes sense because it was a really great spot.  She asked us if we minded helping her back her trailer in to the adjacent site because her husband had recently passed and this was her first time out at their favorite campground since.  My dad backed her trailer in and we went back to doing our own thing.

A few hours later she comes over and invites us over for dinner which was pork and beans.  She had an absolutely huge pot of beans and probably like a dozen hot dogs cut up into it which I remember being amused by considering she was just one little old lady but I guess she was hoping for some company.  We accepted even tho we already had eaten and hung out at her site with her for a while, she kinda just seemed like she wanted to talk to people and was sweet as can be.  I remember thinking she reminded me exactly of my grandmother who was your typical sweet old rural Alabama old lady.  

She ended up telling us about how she and her late husband had been going to this pretty out of the way campground for the last 40 years or something (since 1959 or some shit) and had a ton of stories about it etc.  The one I remember is her talking about a flash flood on the river (this campground was in a valley along a river) with some kid about my age probably 30 years previous fishing on the river and her husband basically running down and grabbing him up before the water got too high since the kid didn't realize the gravity of what was going on.  She said the flood came up the banks and wiped out all of the lower few sites along the river in a matter of like 10 minutes.

We probably spent an hour with this lady tops but it was just such a friendly and wholesome interaction that I still think about it in my mid 30s despite this probably being late 90s or so.  She came by a few more times to thank us again for helping her out with the trailer and stuff.  I like to think we made her weekend a little better because she really seemed like she needed some human interaction (judging thru my adult lens of what I was largely unconcerned with at the time as a 10 year old who mostly just wanted to go move rocks around in the river).

Bonus story: much more recently I was camped next to some old graybeard motorcycle dudes with choppers, an American flag on a pole they literally planted into the dirt in their campsite etc, Vietnam vets I think.  My brother and I were walking down to the creek to try to catch some trout, they yelled something like good luck as we walked past.  As luck would have it we pretty much immediately caught a decent trout big enough to eat so we were walking back with a good sized trout all of 20 mins later to cook up.  Dudes were so pumped about this (they were deep in drink at this point despite it being about 3 in the afternoon) they practically lobbed a few beers at our head so we brought them over some of the trout snack after we cooked it up on a plank by the fire

What in the world is going on. how is this even legal to charge that much money for a spot of the ground in the woods, that seems insane to me.

1st, My fairly large four-person didn't have enough room for all of my stuff which needed to stay out of frost and dew.

2nd, I froze to death even in a 0¬∫ bag and a ton of wool blankets. (I'm very cold blooded and have a hard-enough time staying warm in the summer haha)

So I bought a massive cabin-tent for way more space to store my gear and my friend's gear in one of the partitions, and a Buddy Indoor-Safe propane heater to warm up the other partition for sleeping. **The problem is,** the entire roof of the tent is mesh, with only the rainfly about 6-8"" off the top of the tent. So what I'm planning on trying, is covering the mesh roof with thin wool survival blankets in an attempt to seal the top and trap some heat. Do you think this would actually work?

I've always slept right on the ground and thought getting above the ground would be colder because of air-flow hahahaSo if I don't want to use a cot, does an air mattress do the trick of stopping the ground from robbing your heat?

I've got a short bed truck with a softopper.... like 64"" bed. I'm curious how long the kingdom cot would be end to end if you've got the head adjusted all the way, as well as how high the head would then be from ground level.

I currently sleep back there diagonally (6ft) but it wastes the whole bed. If I can shrink to one side, it'd be awesome. Can anyone measure it out for me??

- Water ‚Äùcontainer‚Äù (don‚Äôt know the right word) Total of 1L/0.2 Gallons (will need more than that FOR SURE)

- Just add water meals
- Headlamp
- Powerbank

I'm looking for advice on which campgrounds to stay at, if it's feasible with younger kids (roughly 18 months and 5 years - or possibly just the 5 year old), and whether or not to bring a canoe, base camping and hiking around, or backpacking around the island.

I see that there are a lot of campground options. For the 5 year old, this would probably be his second real camping trip, so if we were to bring him, it would need to be a somewhat simple access.

772,1694930593.0,DIY 12v battery shower,"Hi all

I just finished making my own 12 volt completely portable battery powered shower.

It is made from the following parts:

- 20L plastic jerry can
- 12V camp shower kit
- a battery clip to suit Milwaukee 18V M18 battery
- an 18V to 12V DC converter
-12V push button switch
- some 3mm acrylic sheet bent into a gear tray
- neoprene adhesive sealant gasket tape

I cut a large hole in the top so the submersible pump would  fit in. Then I drilled some holes for the nylon compression glands to reticulate the shower hose and pump cable out of.

Next I cut & moulded the piece of acrylic which would act as a gear tray to mount the electrics, as well as a removable cover for the hole so that the pump can be removed for repair or replacement.

I mounted and wired up the switch, battery clip, and DC converter.

All new penetrations through the jerry can have been sealed with neoprene gasket material.

It is not 100% waterproof but it is waterproof enough that it won't spill water in your vehicle on a rough trail, as long as it stays right way up.

To use it, all you need to do is boil some water to add to the cold water inside, plug in a charged Milwaukee M18 battery onto the red clip, carry to where you want to use it, and press the button to operate the pump.

I also have a drop down table on my Jeep tailgate so I leave the jerry can in the rear of the Jeep and use it for washing dishes etc after cooking. 

I think all up it cost me about $100 AUD (roughly $65 USD). It was quite an easy project with just a drill, Dremel, soldering iron, heat gun to bend the plastic and heat shrink wires, and basic hand tools needed.",camping

831,1694728297.0,How to still enjoy camping when the isolation and silence is gone?,"Hello, everyone.

I'm a long time camper, hiker and general outdoorsy person. Part of what I used to enjoy the most about the outdoors was just getting away from people and noise. I am fairly introverted person, so I just feel like I need to get away from people, noise and busy city life in order to recharge myself. Unfortunately, that is just rarely the case anymore. It just seems every year that outdoors hobbies, especially camping, just keep increasing in popularity. I started noticing the popularity increase a bit before COVID and it just sky rocketed after COVID, at least where I like to go (west Texas, east and north New Mexico and all over Arizona). Having read similar stories here and other subs, I know I'm not the only one experiencing this.

Anyway, in an effort to experience quiet and isolation again, I have been trying to get more and more remote and off trail. It is definitely better, but I still encounter people and often obnoxious ones (from my view point anyway). For example, I tried to take up dispersed camping recently, which is less crowded for sure, but it's not an escape. The last night of my most recent dispersed camp, a couple of dudes should up at like 9 pm and were making tons of noise setting up while talking and laughing loudly. While not ideal, I can overlook that. Unfortunately, they started playing extremely loud music (like small concert loud) at 10:30 pm. From what I have been reading on this sub lately, it seems like a lot of people are experiencing similar or worse including theft and threatening behavior while dispersed camping.

So, long story short, I have accepted that I can't escape people or noise anymore. That's just the current reality. However, I would still like to enjoy the outdoors. My question for all the other campers out there is have you found a way to to still enjoy camping without the quiet and isolation? This question is specifically for people who enjoy the isolated and quiet aspect of camping. I get noise and people don't bother many of you. For those who like the quiet, how have you continued to enjoy the outdoors with the quiet gone (if it has gone away like it has for me)?

Edit: Going more remote hasn't helped as I mentioned, so that's why I'm asking how people still have fun camping when it's not quiet. I have accepted people will always be present

Edit 2: I'm not complaining. I fully understand we ""share"" the outdoors with other people. I have never asked anyone I have encountered to leave, to keep quiet or been rude to them in any way. Like I said, I have accepted people will always be around. I want to continue enjoying the outdoors despite that.

Edit 3: Once again, I have gone dispersed camping and tried going more remote. People still show up. Not to mention seedy activity goes on at dispersed campsites as others have mentioned. The southwest US seems to have become very popular. Why? I don't know. I guess the southwest is hot right now (no pun intended). Anyway, that's why I am not asking how to find more quiet, just how to still enjoy the outdoors with people present. Regardless, thanks for all the helpful ideas. Backpacking is definitely a consideration of mine but it is time consuming, and I don't have a lot of gear and can't afford to buy a lot of gear. Still willing to try it out if I can get my wife onboard. Weekday camping is also definitely a consideration but both my wife and I work day jobs and we don't get a ton of leave time. It's hard for us just to take a week off and disappear. If we can though, I'm sure we will find more peace and quiet. I will also try checking out other states like Utah, Nevada, California etc. Again, getting the time off is an issue though. I will also give Hicamp a look. Thank you everyone, appreciate it.",camping

839,1694704892.0,Can you help us grasp how windspeed (~15mph) translates to force on tents and canopies?,"We‚Äôre heading to a festival in Mass this weekend, about 80 miles east of Boston. Weather Underground is predicting 10 ‚Äì 16 mph winds but no rain.  I've never really looked at wind speeds in isolation, so I don't have a concept of how numbers translate to lived experience.   

We have a basic 6-person Coleman tent and a 13' pop-up. 

The tent gets staked down at all points and has done us well thus far in a few heavyish storm, but again I have nothing to compare it to (i.e. was that ‚Äúwow, that was windy!‚Äù a 5 mph or 15 mph situation?). 

The pop-up takes two stakes per leg. In rainstorms, we pull the corner canopy extensions (the short poles that expand the canopy from 10' to 13') and drop the legs down so it's about four feet off the grown rather than fully up. 

None of that protects from other canopies or tents that have taken flight, of course. 

Are 15 mph winds likely to wreak havoc across the festival? A few lost tents and whatnot here and there but generally just very gusty? 

We usually stake so the stake angle is either opposite the rope it's holding (i.e. so it forms an acute angle between the rope and the ground) and in two different angles in each pop-up leg. Any advice on improving that? 

Lastly, since we're going to be staking the heck out of things, any advice on how to get those straight stakes (the ones with a slightly larger top, not with a hook to it) out of the ground when it's time to go? They're usually difficult, but I imagine over-securing things is likely to make it a nightmare to pull them up, especially those that are flush with the metal legs of the pop-up.

I live in Kentucky near the woods, for the record. The bugs currently are a pain during the day, but at dusk they seem to chill out, but I don't know if they will start bugging (excuse the pun) us after we stop moving, and not sure if bug spray alone will do the trick.

As far as dew goes, the ground definitely gets wet, but if we are elevated 5-10 feet (depending on which floor we are sleeping on), will that still be an issue?

866,1694623246.0,Walking through your camp,"TLDR: guy walks through my campsite to fish and says I'm the asshole when I tell him it is rude.

I want to check to see if I was rude in this situation.   The other day I was at a BLM campsite.  This spot has 4 camp sites, they are quite obvious from a fireplace and stone picnic table.  Since this location is by a river two of the camp spots have little paths people have picked through to get to the water.  One path is roughly 10-15 feet long and the other is about 35ft long.  There is also a boat ramp with extra parking right by the bathroom.

I got there super early and picked one of the camp spots with water access.  It was the edge of a hill, the picnic table, about 3 ft from that the firepit, then 4 ft from that my truck bed.  So i was in the spot and relatively compaxt.  I was in camp putting a few things in the truck about to walk the dog when all of a sudden a big yellow lab comes walking into my camp.  Right after that a guy comes up and goes we are just going to the fishing spot.  He walks right past me, between the fire pit and my truck, then to the path that leads to the water.  I was kind of dumbstruck but still took my dog on a walk.  A minute later I saw his friend and asked to confirm.   I told him it was quite rude to walk through a camp spot to fish.  He said they would watch out but then when I got to camp it was obvious he had went through it to go meet his buddy.

A little later the original guy came through and basically said I was wrong for saying it was rude.  I told him he can't just walk through a camp site, one that is at a designated spot, when somebody is there.  I told him it was extremely rude and asked what if my dog was the aggressive type?  He tried to say he was a local so that's what they do but I don't quite believe that part.  He also hinted that if he didnt have his 2 year old strapped to his chest there would be a fight.  I've camped around the country and never had somebody do this.

To add one more piece of information, his friend didn't come back through my camp.  There was a larger, recreation area 125 yards down the road.  In the river they were literally closer to the water access at that recreation area and not the camping area so his friend exited that way.

So basically, am I an asshole or am I right in thinking that guy was full of shit and rude for doing that?",camping

I set it up in my yard. I put down a cheap ground tarp and set the tent up on top of it - then sprayed it down with a hose to check if it was leaky or needed some waterproofing / resealing. The fly seemed to be waterproof - but there was some pooling coming from the floor. I don't know a lot about tents; can this be solved by 're water proofing' this or have I wasted my money?

Since the tarp extended beyond the fly, the water was caught and 'pooled up' directly under the tent, which may have been part of the reason - but I would figure the base of most tents should be able to hold up to something like that, no?

Is there another test I can try? I just want to make sure I don't wake up soaked if it rains while I'm using this tent :)

Woke up around 3am this morning to them laughing at the top of their lung, talking loudly, Tiktok blaring and they didnt quiet down until 5 and then right back at it around 6. 

It's dispersed camping so sure there really aren't any rules but I think its common decency to be quiet at those hours. Half asleep after listening to them for an hour I sat up and yelled out ""Hey, shut the f up"" twice but they either didn't hear me or didnt care. Walked over this morning mostly to apologize for yelling out at them, everyone I've met at this spot has been overly friendly so I thought it might just be a chance to strike up a conversation but the guy wasn't having it so I just asked kindly to keep it down at night, this guys partner jumps out of the car like a rabid dog ""nobody gives an f, we dont care about your sleep nobody gives an f I'm gonna run you over with my car"", I had to have had my mouth agape I was just shocked like wtf... I said a few things just to end the conversation, turned and walked away. Tempted to pack up and leave just to get away from them because truly, wtf. 

Not sure where Im going with this...

893,1694548719.0,Coleman Carlsbad review,"
I purchased the Coleman Carlsbad 4 person tent for use camping at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival this past weekend. For those who don't know, it ended up a shit show, one of the major problems being a massive out of nowhere spinoff storm that did a ton of damage to tents cars and canopies. 

I initially bought this tent because I liked the screened in porch, and I figured the darkroom technology would be useful in case we wanted to sleep in a little bit after long nights without the sun shining in our faces. That feature did turn out to be the second best aspect of the tent - not because of the sun, but because we ended up being camped directly underneath one of those massive generator lights. It was like camping beneath a mini sun, but yet when we crawled into bed each night, you'd never know the blazing glow of the only thing that worked at that festival was there. 

The best feature was by far the waterproofing. If you've seen some reviews saying the screened in area is not at all waterproof, those complaints are definitely true. It could use some additional setup to help keep some of the water out, but it was perfect for leaving our already wet clothes, and honestly having a slight second layer of security to the tent opening setup. Beyond the porch layer of the tent though, the waterproofing was phenomenal. Neighbors all around us were blowing out of the ground and flooding and some were literally flying through the air, but not the Coleman Carlsbad. We stayed dry, even *with the windows open* at times. We didn't even have a tarp layer down under the tent.

Additional perks: the pockets on the back side were super handy and nicely sized for storing everything from water bottles and charging phones to medications, and the top hook was perfect to add a light and fan for the heat. We didn't end up using the screened in area (see: rain and also 7' tall friend who wouldn't fit) but it would have been great if there were bugs and better weather. My husband did end up taking a nap in there on one of the drier days lol. 

Cons: I really don't have a lot of complaints, but one thing I will say is the entrance to the screened in area definitely needs a way to be staked down in the middle, because otherwise you need two hands to get out and idk about y'all but I don't have the brain power to use both hands at 7am.

Recommendations: I would definitely recommend a tarp under the tent and an additional rain fly setup for the screened in area if you're anticipating wet weather and want that part to be dry. I would also recommend heavier duty tent stakes - while the majority of the stakes we used held up to the rain and wind of the storms (only one came out and it probably wasn't in right), a number of them bent as we tried to stake the tent down (which is probably why the one wasn't in right), so honestly we're definitely springing for something larger and stronger next time.

Overall, 9.5/10 for the Coleman Carlsbad, I may never buy another tent again",camping

Am new to this subreddit but have been camping for years across the US. Am curious to know if anyone has had a similar experience, or advice for something that happened last weekend. 

Basically, I was camping in a state park (a full state park, families and other campers all around) by myself, as a female. I woke up at 330 AM Saturday night/Sunday morning to find the lone male camping next door to me walking next to my tent and staring down at me. I freaked out, and left. 

No matter how long I try to steel man his behavior, I just can't come up with a reason why he would: 

1. be on my campsite at all, at 330 am no less. our sites are large and would not be incidental that he'd traversed from his site to mine

2. be where he was standing, which is directly next to my tent in the least reasonable place to be standing (just a sliver of space between tent and picnic bench, but closest space to my head) if he was genuinely just trying to walk across my site 

3. looking down into my tent watching me, as i was sleeping

I left the campsite immediately, in the middle of the night, and notified the park. Any thoughts or advice?

930,1694445429.0,Is Camping in the garden weird ?,"I used to live in a different country where they were a lot of national parks and small campsites. You could choose between ones with showers and toilets and kids clubs to the most basic campsites which just had a long drop toilet. No water, no flushing toilet, no nothing. 

I've gone camping by myself once and found it kinda fun. Slightly lonely but overall really enjoyed it. 

I've since moved country and now the only campsite I can find have all the bells and whistles. 
Even the basic campsites in this country have kids clubs, toilets and shower blocks. 
Not what I wanted at all. 

If I just set up my tent in the garden and sleep in that for a few nights. As a single adult. Does that come across as sort of pathetic? 

With a house right there etc. 

But I kinda liked the whole sleeping in the tent, curled up in my sleeping bag, cooking my food on my little heater etc 

But at the other campsite I went hiking around the woods and relaxing by the tent etc. 

Is it a little pathetic to just be sat in my garden reading a book ? 

I would like to try and find friends to go camping with but again I like the basic camping , take everything with you because there are barely anything supplied for you kinda camping. 

There was a fire pit at the campsite and I loved sitting around it during the afternoon and evening but I can't light a fire pit in my garden. So I think I'll just be sat there bored or reading or watching things on Netflix or something because there is nothing else to do.

I have all this gear just gathering dust in the garage and really don't know what to do with it.",camping

I wanted to thank the subreddit for some great suggestions, and I will certainly put it all together as I build my kit for my coming trip.

Please don't go tent camping with your newborn.,"I'm probably going to be downvoted into oblivion, but I feel so frustrated when I go camping and have to listen to someone else's baby wailing all night. I came to the wilderness to  be in nature, to be soothed to sleep by the sound of insects, night birds, and armadillos checking out the trash bag at the campsite next to mine.

&#x200B;

Last time I went camping I had to listen to a newborn baby screaming his displeasure for several *hours*, two nights in a row. It kept me up and made it more difficult for me to get up early the next mornings.

&#x200B;

I have to save my vacation time very carefully for these trips. I go twice a year and they are the highlight of my broke millennial life. I just feel like it's rude to bring such a small child to a place where other people's sleep can be disturbed.

&#x200B;

Yes, I could choose hike-ins, but I shouldn't *have* to. If someone else went to a public campsite and started an all-night freestyle rap competition without notifying the other guests, everyone would agree that's not cool.",camping

It's not very well-known. That's why we like it, though. We come here often. We're currently staying with our two very young kids. My husband and I are the only adults. We also have our dog. 

Earlier this evening we had an odd experience where a truck with a man and woman stopped by our camp site. They asked if we'd stayed at this particular campground before, and we said we had. They said that we need to be careful, because it's not safe here. We said that we'd been coming here for a few years and never felt unsafe. They went on to say that there's no cell service and no way to call for help (usually that's true,  but for some reason tonight we do have service). They said there's a lot of drugs.

They drove off and the only other camper here also left. There are two vacant tents near us and a vacant camper on the other end of the campground. There are no other cars. It seems we are 100% alone here tonight. 

My husband thinks we'll be fine. The conversation left me with a bad gut feeling, though. I feel very uneasy- especially because we have our kids. 

What would you do in this situation?

UPDATE: We're ALIVE! We took our kids home and came back out ourselves. The guy who warned us proceeded to sit and fish most of the night. I'm guessing he was upset someone was sharing his ""good spot"".",camping

1928,1693583891.0,What to do with outdoor gear you don‚Äôt need anymore.,"I work/live in a National Park in the U.S. and this year more than any year I have noticed an alarming amount of outdoor gear thrown away into trash cans. I‚Äôm not talking like, a broken tent pole, I‚Äôm talking about entire tents, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, backpacks, etc. And I get it- we‚Äôve been seeing a ton of international visitors this year who likely can‚Äôt bring back all of the items they purchased for their trips. Or, perhaps, people are going camping and deciding they hate it and never want to do it again.  No judgement. Yesterday though I ran into a group throwing away a bunch of totally fine gear, and stopped and asked why. They said they didn‚Äôt know what else to do with these things since they can‚Äôt take them home with them due to limited space.

I am posting here today- **if you are traveling or wind up with outdoor gear you cannot take with you or do not want anymore that is still usable, please consider donating it to a non profit in need or taking it to a local thrift-store or consignment shop** (you can even get money back for this!) 

Another option too is to stop in at the Visitor Center at the National Park/National Forest you are visiting and ask if they have any need for the items you don‚Äôt want any more- a lot of parks have backcountry programs or work with conservation corps/youth corps that could utilize the gear!  

To make this even easier for anyone that might be in this situation, I did a google search for different organizations and companies in the United States that take in used outdoor gear, and here are some that I found:

For more information on recycling/donating gear, click [here](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/how-to-retire-gear.html).

An option to consider too- instead of purchasing new gear for your trips, [consider renting](https://www.rei.com/stores/rentals)! REI has many rental options and locations available. There may be small local gear shops that rent equipment where you are traveling too. This is also a great way to try out gear you might be considering purchasing back home. 

If none of these work for you and your travels, consider dropping your gear off at any local thriftstore or larger ones such as Goodwill/Salvation Army/Savers/Deseret Industries etc., since used gear going to any of these is still better than ending up in a landfill. Thanks all!

**ETA:** holy smokes, y‚Äôall. I had no idea this would blow up like it did. And thanks for my first awards ever! There‚Äôs been some amazing suggestions in the comments, so I wanted to add them to my list. **Feel free to DM me if you know of a non-profit accepting gear donations and I will add it to this list.** I‚Äôm going to hold off on posting more consignment shops **because there‚Äôs a lot of them** but visit the link I posted above for a comprehensive list by state someone has already put together!

[PEER-TO-PEER EQUIPMENT RENTALS Geer Garage](https://geergarage.com)- Seattle, WA 

A lot of folks mentioned donating gear to help the homeless. I highly recommend checking out the [National Coalition for the Homeless directory](https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org) to find a shelter where you are traveling from that might be in need to donate to. [GearJunkie](https://gearjunkie.com/winter/old-gear-homeless-donation) also has a great article on this. 


Another option before buying gear- check with your local library or the library where you are visiting about potential gear rentals. Some libraries also allow you to check out Park passes! Just another reason to love them. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Finally, I want to add that increasing gear availability and supporting initiatives aimed at promoting accessibility to all is community health- both when it comes to the natural world and the human side of things. And the more people we have that are passionate about protecting wild spaces and advocating for the outdoors we all love, the better.

Sincerely,
Your friendly neighborhood Park Ranger",camping

2844,1694384148.0,Obnoxious campers in Shenandoah,"After 30+ years in a tent, last night was definitely one of my least enjoyable nights. We were in Shenandoah and the group next to us had 4 cars parked on a spot. (Two on the grass.) A ranger came by and told them to move two cars and buy another spot. They did, but only parked the cars there and set up tents in the same camp. Long story short, at about 12 am they started drunkenly screaming and slamming car doors until 430 a.m. The campground hosts did nothing. Finally, at 430, the surrounding tents starting yelling, shut the \*\*\*\* up, in near unison and they went to bed. However, instead of going to tents they got into their Teslas and left them running for a few hours.

A few surrounding campers said they had repeatedly asked the group to be quiet throughout the night to no avail.

After we broke camp, my wife and I walked over to group and I kindly explained how disrespectful they had been to the entire campground. They were speaking in Chinese, but definitely knew English (talking to me and ranger). I said after years of camping I had never experienced such a disrespectful group and they come back to be more considerate to others in the site. The guy said whatever and walked away so I simply said I will let the ranger station on the way out in hopes they would issue a fine. He said, ""Go ahead"", so I did. Not only where they loud, but they also did not follow bear procedures. They ruined at least a dozen campers night and its not insignificant getting into Shenandoah sites (30 to reserve; 20 to enter or use a park pass).

Thankfully, another couple complained at the ranger station at the same time and they said they would send a ranger to the site. I think a fine is the only way future campers might have a better experience next to this group.

So whats your worst campground experience in a national park?

2849,1694387427.0,Camped in the best campsite this weekend!,"Wisconsin State Park Kettle Moraine - Southern Unit, Pinewoods campground, site 266 if anybody is going that way. 

Extra long driveway to a secluded site, couldn‚Äôt even see any other sites or even the road because the driveway was angled a bit. Wooded area with lots of trees, but almost no bugs. Water spigot at the end of the driveway, PIT toilets across the road, flush toilets just a 3-minute walk with private shower rooms instead of stalls. The campsite had 2 trees spaced perfectly for a hammock, 2 other trees we strung up a clothesline between, and a great area for the tent. 

It was just the best campsite for tent camping I think. So great. The hiking trails were very nice, and there‚Äôs a great beach we went to in the afternoon. 

Highly recommend!",camping

2864,1466559122.0,REI neutered their warranty- where should I start shopping?,"For a long time, I've bought nothing but REI branded gear. I could walk into an REI anywhere in the country and get a zipper repaired, a tear patched, etc. Always for free and without waiting. I always considered this the ""free oil change"" of outdoor gear, with how much I spend there every year.

It's probably not news to anyone here, but at some point in the past few years they have abandoned their warranty. No more lifetime support. I tried today to get a zipper repair on a (fairly expensive) REI down jacket that had a YKK fail. They now consider this ""wear & tear"". No grandfathering for products bought under a better warranty. In any case, salad days are over, and all my old REI gear will need replacement when it breaks.

I've heard good things about North Face. Have a friend with two free zipper repairs on a 15 year old bag. Any other recommendations? I'll pay more for the level of support REI used to have. I'd like to know that when I'm in a bind 5 years from now, the manufacturer will be in business, and I'd like retail locations. When you're packing for a trip and notice a failed zipper, mailing your gear away won't help.

edit: Please, on topic posts only. I'm looking for gear manufacturers who offer lifetime repair support. Zippers are not the topic‚ÄîI also use stoves, hammocks, therma-rests, knives, etc. REI manufactured their own versions of all these products.

My extended family will be having a big get- together at a campsite deep in bear county and it's looking like my Wife's period will be starting the day we get there, or within a day or so of us arriving. 

What can we do to minimize risk to ourselves and our fellow campers? 

Couple things to note: 

We are not going to a designated campground, but to an area my family frequents for camping. The bears in the area will not be used to human interaction.

We will be tenting.

We have bear boxes for trash and food, so the used hygiene products will hopefully not cause issues. I'm more worried about her person.

2878,1670199324.0,Question about babies and camping,"Hi everyone, I'm looking for thoughts and opinions from campers with and without children so I can have a better understanding of camping culture and how to manage my expectations properly.

I just got back from a camping trip with my fiance where we reserved a hike-in spot that was 2 miles in from the trailhead. At the trailhead there was a huge campsite that was super family friendly with playgrounds and lots of facilities for kiddos of any age. We personally wanted to have a quieter experience where we were surrounded by more nature sounds than people sounds, so that's why we chose the hike-in.

For both nights that we camped at our site, the family camping at the nearest site to us (~50 ft away?) had a little baby who clearly was not enjoying their stay, and they cried and screamed at the top of their lungs every hour for the entirety of both nights. My fiance and I were exhausted (as I'm sure the parents were too) and obviously frustrated at the lack of sleep. I also felt that the parents were being quite disrespectful towards the other hike-in campers by both bringing a baby out to a hike-in spot when there were facilities available at the campsite near the trailhead to make it easy to calm the baby if they started to be loud (restrooms or your car nearby to take the baby in) and also for continuing to stay out there after the baby already cried through the first night.

I get that babies cry and I don't think the parents shouldn't be able to camp just because they have a little one, but I was under the impression that if you wanted a quieter camp you booked hike-in spots and if you were camping at a typical car-camping/family friendly you should expect noise (or know that those types of camping spots might be more appropriate if you feel like you will make a fair amount of noise).

I'm aware that it's possible I've just been lucky to have never had noisy neighbors at any hike-in spots and/or that I could be overreacting out of exhaustion. But I'm also curious because, with any posts I've seen on this sub in the past complaining about noise from others (babies included), the solution proposed is that said complainer should've chosen a hike-in spot, which we did. What are all of your thoughts about this?",camping

Is it that common to go camping with fire arms in the US? Cause I know up here in Canada even if we're heading out back country camping like not in parks with park staff we don't generally have fire arms with us... unless of course it's hunting season. I mean the odd person might bring a rifle for target practice but majority of Canadians who go back woods hiking/camping do not bring guns.   We just kinda deal with animal encounters as one would expect any sane person to do... be aware of your surroundings. Remember most animals are more scared of you than you of them. Make yourself appear bigger and stronger. And make plenty of noise so you don't surprise any.  For example when I'm out in my tent and worried a bear is poking around well its time for 99 bottles of beer on the wall nice and loud (which honestly is enough to scare away just about anything lol) Bear Mace is cool but I've never actually brought any since it's relatively new and I never used it when I was young doing the exact same thing... so I dunno.... maybe Canadians are super bad ass when it comes to camping in the back country by themselves,camping

I went out to my car and found some quarters, but the machine wouldn't take those, and I had no dollar bills to exchange for tokens (I found a machine for tokens at the park entrance).

2949,1608045754.0,Are Rooftop Tents Worth It?,"Today most people employ a ground tent set up when camping. They are compact, easy to carry, and provide protection from the elements.

With the invention of the roof top tent, another mode of camping has arisen. As the off-road community grows and more people choose to camp in the backcountry in their 4x4 vehicles, rooftop tents have become increasingly popular.

This guide is meant to help you consider the pros and cons of each option and determine whether it is worth it to buy a rooftop tent.

## Ground Tent

Pros:

* Compact and easy to transport
* Lower cost
* More stable in wind
* Traditional camping feel

Cons:

* More work to set up
* Exposed to ground critters

## Rooftop Tent

Pros:

* Quickly deployable
* Always attached to your car
* Security sleeping above the ground

Cons:

* Expensive $$$
* Takes up a lot of space

## Conclusion

It is important to choose the right tent for your specific needs, which can vary based on where you live, your vehicle, and what type of overlanding you do.

For those who need to park their car in a garage, the rooftop tent may cause issues with height clearance. Additionally, if you need more space for gear on your trips a rooftop tent may take up too much space and you may want to opt for the ground tent.

For some it may be worth dropping the extra $$$ on a rooftop tent. If you spend a lot of time camping and move spots often, it can be easy to have the rooftop tent ready for action along the way. Additionally, you may feel more secure camping on the roof opposed to the ground

A rooftop tent is a big investment, so consider your needs and how well the rooftop tent fits those needs. Consider the benefits as well as the drawbacks before jumping into the purchase.

BUT, my body is too high maintance for camping.

(1) I can't sleep in sleeping bags, I feel trapped, especially my legs, cuz at home i sleep in X shape....

(2) Sleep temperature is REALLY important for me. I can't do anything that isn't between 67 to 74F, and dry.

(3) After I use the restroom i have to wash and soak my rear in a basin of hot water because i have hemorrhoid. I tried the wet wipes, doesn't work, hurt as hell, and it will keep hurting until i soak it.

What should i do? I even tried ""Glamping"", still couldn't sleep cuz that wooden stove thing keeps getting too hot and too cold, the whole night i was waking up to put more wood or closing the vent to make the fire smaller. So I would go camping during the summer, but i will not get any rest, but i still like it, i just can't do it for more than 2 nights cuz i need to check into a hotel to sleep. ",camping

Even a small pistol. Sure, it‚Äôs highly unlikely to kill a bear, or a charging mountain lion with a pistol, but there‚Äôs a high chance you can scare it off by firing a few rounds in the air. 

A lot of those horror stories of campers/hikers getting mauled by an animal could have possibly been avoided.

Edit: the reason I thought of posting this, I just got off a YouTube binge of the YouTube Reddit videos about encounters in the wilderness.

3003,1395089312.0,My worst night of camping: Teenagers on the run and getting firecrackers shot at me.,"Every year in the Spring, my boy scout troop goes to this awesome military base for a camping trip. It's not like normal camping trips where we hike or something: We do swimming, golfing, ping pong, and all sorts of awesome stuff. It's consistently one of the best weekends of the year. Most years, despite the awesomeness *something* goes wrong, as they generally do on camping trips. One year I forgot to bring money, another I got really sick... But this one takes the cake.

It was the last night of our trip, and our troop decided to play a big game of capture the flag. And I mean **BIG.** It went from a field behind our campsite, the other team's base, through a fairly large forest, past an arcade, and across a big field to a baseball field which was our area. The game went pretty slow, considering our troop is rather small, but it was really fun. About an hour in (it was close to pitch black at this point) while I was playing defense, I saw the entire other team and some of ours running to us. While I was thinking *""I'm gonna have to play some really good defense,""* they started yelling at me and another guy who was playing defense to come over. I remember thinking something like *""Do they think I'm stupid?""* But after some more yelling we walked over.

Turns out that some teenager ran away and was on the run from the cops right around us. Also, the police description of them sounded exactly like me (not relevant, but I was scared shitless). We walked back to the campsite, and we were the only ones out. When we were exactly one campsite over from ours, all hell broke loose. There was suddenly a group of teenagers a few yards away from us, yelling and cussing. Then I see some sort of bright red thing being shot at us from them. I didn't think *""The hell? Is this related to the guy on the run from the cops?""* I didn't think *""What's even happening right now?""* I just thought ***""HOLY FUCK THERE ARE FIRECRACKERS BEING SHOT AT US, RUN!""*** They probably would only have given us minor injuries had they hit us, but it was the scariest, most adrenaline filled moment of my life so I just booked it. Fast forward to when we are back at the campsite, me and another guy are walking to the tents about to go and sleep and he says something to sum it up perfectly.

""I'm fucking done with this camping trip.""

I have no idea if the guy on the run had anything to do with the firecrackers, or why they shot them at us (probably just assholes screwing around). There was also a guy that came to our campsite telling a pretty badass story of how he caught the guy a bit later, but at that point I didn't care. I just wanted to leave.",camping

I did wake up feeling a bit chilly at times. Overall, on my feet (because they were against the door of my small tent that is cheap and just one layer) and on my back (cold coming from the ground).

The problem with the bag is that it doesn't really close all the way at the neck/shoulders, so that air can come in from the top. I use my liner try to prevent that (and I can put it over my head as a cap to keep warmer), but there's most likely still air coming in that I can't prevent. So I'm going to test if other cheap bags can close up at the top so that no air can get in. If not I'm sticking with this cheap bag.

Now I was wondering if buying [5 euro fleece blanket](http://imgur.com/a/io4Z1) will help? I also got this super thin blanket I got for free on an airplane, but I'm thinking that might not do much and fleece will.

Also since my matras clealy doesn't completely keep the cold from  the ground away, I was thinking of buying a cheap 5 euro[ silver reflective pad](http://imgur.com/a/eHMxo). It's like the camping pads/yoga mats with silver reflective stuff, but without the cushion and just a pretty thin layer (positive: it doesn't take up much space). Would that keep the cold from the ground away better?

I was also considering buying [a better tent](http://nl.decathlon.be/arpenaz-2-id_8347889.html) that's bigger so my feet don't touch it. And one that has two layers. This will probably be warmer, and also better to stop condensation on the inside of the inner layer. (it probably also has better ventilation, not sure though)

**TL;DR** 

- Is a [5 euro fleece blanket](http://imgur.com/a/io4Z1) over my sleeping bag going to keep me warmer/worth buying (and prevent air from coming in the bag at the neck/shoulders)?

- Is a [silver/aluminium reflective coating pad](http://imgur.com/a/eHMxo) (without the thick cushion) on top of a self inflated pad going to keep me warmer from the ground or is the silver pad not going to do much?

3037,1454003249.0,RV Extended Warranties,"Extended warranties of any kind are not well thought of and, often, that's for good reason. Stories abound about warranty companies not paying claims and seemingly going out of their way not to pay.

In addition, they are often expensive and when they don't provide the expected coverage, frustration levels shoot through the roof.

In general, I'm not a big fan of extended warranties, but they can have value if we understand their purpose, we have the right expectations, and we don't have to pay too much.

We've had very good experiences with the extended warranties on our fifth wheel, and we've been kicking ourselves for not having one on our truck when we lost the engine. For the right price and coverage, they can make a lot of sense on RVs, cars, trucks, SUVs, boats, motorcycles, ATVs, snowmobiles, and personal watercraft.

So we're going to explore the pros and cons and try to provide tips on how to get the most out of an extended warranty.

Extended Warranty Basics

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a ""warranty"" as:

""a usually written guarantee of the integrity of a product and of the maker's responsibility for the repair or replacement of defective parts"".

That's a fairly standard definition and implies a ""warranty"" is something issued by the manufacturer of a product AND it is included in the price of the product.

What we are talking about here are technically ""service contracts"". The purpose is basically the same as a warranty, but it may or may not be issued by the manufacturer, it provides coverage for an extended period beyond the manufacturer's warranty, and, of course, there is an additional fee or ""premium"".

However, for our purposes here, we will use the terms ""extended warranty"" and ""extended service contract"" interchangeably. 

The Players Involved

In the ""extended service contract"" business, it's important to know who's who in the process.

Buyer - This is you, the purchaser of the extended service contract.

Contract Provider/Seller - The company that completes the extended service contract application and is responsible for calculating the contract quote and collecting the fee from the Buyer. This could be a manufacturer, a dealer, or an independent warranty provider.

Administrator - The company that actually pays the claims and makes the final decision on what is covered and not covered under the contract. The Administrator usually works directly with the Repair Facility. The Administator takes the largest portion of the ""premium"" (or fee) and places it in a ""claims reserve account"" to pay future claims.

Insurance Company - The company that is financially responsible for making sure claims get paid even if the Administrator were to become insolvent. It's important to ensure the financial status of the insurance company backing the ""claims reserve account"" is solid.

Note: In most states, extended service contracts are not treated as insurance and therefore they are not regulated by state insurance commissioners. However, the best plans are backed by insurance companies as a ""specialty"" line in their overall business. Be cautious of plans backed by ""Risk Retention Groups"" rather than regulated insurance companies.

Service Repair Facility - This is the company (i.e. RV dealer, RV service center, mobile RV tech, etc.) where you have repairs completed. The Repair Facility submits a repair plan and estimated costs to the Administrator for pre-authorization.
RV Extended Warranty Pros & Cons

Again, I'm just like most people when it comes to extended warranties or service contracts. I'm skeptical and I hate paying for a new product and then paying an additional fee with expectations that my new toy, whatever it is, is probably going to break. However, when we are talking about an RV, we're talking about something that is several thousands of dollars and a single repair can have a devastating effect on the bank account.

RV manufacturing is quite unlike auto manufacturing or any other highly controlled manufacturing process. On any given day, any manufacturer can produce an RV that is substandard in one or more of many areas. It doesn't matter what type of RV or how much the RV costs, all manufacturers occasionally make mistakes.

Not only that, but the manufacturers substitute or change components all the time. The components in the same exact RV models may be different due to a shortage from one supplier, a change in component pricing, an engineering decision, etc.

So, let's look at reasons to purchase and reasons not to purchase an extended service contract for your RV.

Reasons To Purchase

Peace of Mind - Answering the following questions may help determine if ""peace of mind"" is a major factor for you.

Do you hate surprise expenses, especially costly RV repairs?Ôªø
Would you sleep better at night knowing that certain major repairs will be covered under an extended service contract? Or would you rather risk it and pay for repairs when and if they are needed?Ôªø
Again, the RV manufacturing process is different. There is a tremendous amount of human involvement. RV factories aren't full of computer programmed robots with precise processes. And humans make mistakes.

Budget Control - We use insurance to manage the risks of major financial outlays in our lives. Extended service contracts can take on that role as far as RV repairs go. More questions for you.

Will the cost of replacing a pricey electrical part or air conditioner or refrigerator or transmission bust your monthly or annual budget? Or do you have a few thousand dollars tucked away in an emergency fund for just these kinds of expenses?
An extended warranty is also somewhat of a hedge against rising prices. The warranty company will pay retail prices at the time of the repair, but the warranty Buyer can be insulated from those price increases. In other words, once you purchase a contract, the Administrator can't come to you in year three asking you for more money because prices have gone up.

Resale Value - This isn't necessarily a major reason to have an extended service contract, but it certainly provides a seller with an advantage and it provides a buyer of a used RV with some peace of mind.

Repair Experts - Though most people don't think of a warranty Adminstrator as looking out for their best interests, it is true that Administrators provide ""checks and balances"" that ensure repair facilities are not overcharging. 

Reasons NOT To Purchase

These are reasons NOT to buy an extended service contract.

You will be disappointed and upset if you buy an extended warranty to:


To cover regular maintenance items
To cover pre-existing items (repairs needed before the service contract is purchased)
To fill gaps in your RV collision and/or comprehensive insurance
To provide roadside assistance (though extended warranties do have some roadside assistance coverage, it's not a primary part of the contract and specialized RV roadside assistance plans are much better)
To cover rust, corrosion, or poorly maintained vehicles

Reasons You May Not Be Able To Get An Extended Warranty On A Used RV

Your motorhome has too many miles (Most companies will write new contracts on motorhomes with mileage up to 100,000 miles; for some companies the limit is 80,000 miles; Wholesale Warranties works with one company that offers coverage up to 125,000 miles)
Your RV is too old (Most companies have age limits for coverage) - Coverage may be available for RVs up to 15 years, but always inquire if your RV is over 10 years old.
Buying An RV Extended Warranty - What To Look For

When buying an extended service contract for your RV, you want value, coverage, contract protection, flexibility and convenience, and service.

Value - Often RV buyers and owners forgo extended service contracts because the cost is hard to justify. Part of the problem is they don't know where or how to shop warranties.

For starters, extended warranties can have huge built-in profits for RV dealers (and auto dealers), and the dealer finance office is often a place where an extended warranty is presented. The extended warranty can actually create more profit than the RV sale itself. Therefore, there is often pressure to buy the warranty at time of sale and pressure to include the cost in the RV financing.

You certainly don't have to buy an extended warranty from your dealer, nor do you need to be in a rush to purchase one. So, if you have decided you would like an extended warranty, shop around and you can save lots of money. The significant savings can make the warranty much more justifiable and reasonable.

Note: Keep in mind that you don't want to wait too long to buy your extended warranty. The longer you wait, the more expensive it will be. In other words, the older your RV gets, the more it will cost to get extended warranty coverage. Just like your health or life insurance gets more expensive as you age, so does an extended warranty. So shop around, but lock in the best pricing you can get as soon as you can.

Now, having said that you can find less expensive extended warranty coverage, be cautious of going too cheap. Be very careful of unsolicited, very, very low priced warranty offers you may receive via the mail, spam email, or telemarketing.

Coverage - It is very important that you understand the coverage being offered. The contracts can be very complicated, but always try to get a copy of the contract so that you have plenty of time to review it before purchase.

Types of coverage

Exclusionary Contract - An exclusionary contract is what you want. This type of coverage includes every mechanical aspect of your RV except for what is specifically ""Exluded from coverage"" or listed as ""Exclusions"" or ""What Is Not Covered"" in the contract.

Note: Exclusionary contracts can have multiple levels of coverage and may have specific provisions that exclude coverage in lower levels and include coverage in higher levels of coverage. Be sure that you request the most comprehensive coverage available.

Listed Component Contract - This type of contract lists only what will be specifically covered. If it's not listed, it's not covered. This type of contract can make it very difficult to determine what is NOT covered.

Note: Though you want comprehensive coverage (the best coverage available in an exlusionary contract), depending on the year and condition of your RV, that coverage may just be too expensive. However, you may still be able to get Listed Component coverage for your motorhome or towable.

Contract Protection - One thing you don't want to have to worry about is completely losing the money you invested in an extended warranty. You hope you don't need the coverage or have any claims, but you certainly don't want your money to disappear leaving you with no coverage at all.

Therefore, it is very important to check out the financial condition of the insurance company backing the Administrators' ""claims reserve account"". Ask about those insurers and get their A.M. Best ratings - look for ""A-rated"" insurers.

Be wary of ""Risk Retention Groups"" that are backing extended service contracts. They are not regulated as well as insurance companies and several have gone bust. There are a few good ones, but I, personally, would want more security.

Flexibility and Convenience - When you are looking for an extended warranty, you want to be able to access repair facilities of your choosing wherever you may be at the time of a breakdown. Be careful of warranties that require you to use certain repair facilities or networks thus limiting where you can go for service.

Service - One thing that is often missing when you buy an extended warranty is service from your Contract Provider (the company from which you bought the contract). Unfortunately, too often there is little or no assistance from the people that sell you an extended warranty. Many simply want to make a sale and wash their hands of any future issues.

A top-notch Contract Provider will offer you after-the-sale service. There can be disputes between repair facilities and Administrators as to the extent of repairs, the labor for repairs, the necessity for repairs, and the coverage for repairs. And there, no doubt, can be finger-pointing going both ways. Often the Buyer is caught in the middle, so it's always a plus to have a Contract Provider that can serve as a mediator to try to work out a solution on your behalf.

Other Items To Look For:

Deductibles - Make sure you know the deductible and whether it is a ""per visit"" or ""per item"" deductible. You don't want to pay a deductible on every repaired part, so make sure that you only pay one deductible per repair facility visit.  Also, higher deductibles can mean a lower overall price of the extended warranty, and savings can be significant (Note: the savings from a higher deductible tend to be more significant for motorized RVs than for towables).
Payment Of Claims - Be sure that the warranty Administrator pays the repair facility directly. It's a big red flag if the Administrator requires you to pay the repair facility out-of-pocket and then submit receipts for reimbursement. Now, with that said, also be cautious of repair facilities that won't work with warranty companies and/or that require you to pay them up front and you have to file your own claims to get reimbursed.
Repair Facility Payment - Be sure that the warranty Administrator will pay the repair facility via corporate credit card. The repair facility doesn't want to wait for a check and the sooner they get paid, the sooner you can be on the road.
Retail Costs - Also, make sure the warranty Administrator pays full retail to the repair facility for parts and labor. They may disagree on the number of hours for the repair or on the parts to be used, but once they work that out, the repair facility should receive full retail prices.
Transferability - Make sure that your extended warranty is transferable. There may be a small transfer fee, but if you sell your RV having the remainder of an extended warranty on it could make for a quicker sale. Of course, in the case of a sale, you may decide to cancel and get a check back (see ""Cancellation"" below) rather than transferring it.
Cancellation - Determine what the cancellation policy is. Can you cancel within 30 or 60 days and get a full refund? What is the refund policy after the initial ""probation"" period? Many extended warranties will give a pro-rated refund based on the time left on the contract if you cancel. There may be an administrative fee to process the cancellation or refund, so know what that cost might be. Also, your refund could be reduced by any claims already paid out (which is reasonable), so be sure to know if that is the case.
Inspections - Does the warranty Administrator require an inspection of your RV? An inspection may be peformed at the time of warranty purchase to identify any ""pre-existing"" conditions. Pre-existing conditions (mechanical issues existing at the time of the purchase of the extended warranty) are not covered, so an inspection helps identify those conditions and may prevent a claim denial later. Inspections are more likely if you are not currently covered by a warranty at the time of the extended warranty purchase.
Additional Benefits - Many extended warranties have towing benefits, roadside assistance benefits, emergency repair provisions, lodging reimbursements, and other minor benefits. Often these have fairly low dollar limits, so know the details and don't expect these benefits to substitute for a specialized RV roadside assistance plan. 
Getting The Most Out Of Your Extended Warranty

In this section, we'll try to explain how to get the most out of your extended warranty. By that I mean, how to use it most effectively and get claims paid without frustration. Stress comes from having expectations too high and those expectations not being met. So, it's important to make sure owners of extended warranties have a realistic expectation of what should happen when a claim is filed.

1. Understand your contract.

Yes, the contract is a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo, but it is important that you understand it. Have someone familiar with warranty contracts review it for you if possible. If that's not possible or too expensive, read over it slowly until you understand it or jot down questions you need answered. Ask the person that is selling you the warranty about provisions you don't understand. Of course, you need to have trust in that individual due to the obvious conflict of interest. Again, the contracts can be complicated, so no one will know every answer to every question, but the good Contract Providers will find the answer for you if they don't know.

With all of the above said, don't be intimidated by the contract. For the most part, repair facilities know what is and isn't covered and Administrators don't go out of their way to deny claims as long as their suspicions aren't raised.

The Administrators have to be on the alert for fraud and misrepresentation so they aren't paying out illegitimate claims at the expense of the honest customers and repair facilities. Yes, the Administrators do sometimes deny claims that certainly aren't fraud or misrepresentation and seem like they should have been approved, but that is the exception rather than the rule, although many incorrectly believe it is the other way around.

2. Understand what is NOT covered.

This is where the most confusion and frustration occurs. When you read a contract, it looks like a lot is not covered, but in an exlusionary contract, at least it's all listed out. Many of the excluded items are common sense (must have a VIN, odometer must be working, items covered by manufacturers warranty or by collision/comprehensive insurance are not covered, etc.).

In some cases, you can add optional coverage for items you are concerned about that are specifically not covered in the base contract.

Many things like lights, batteries, tires, wheels, mirrors, belts, and other items that should be routinely replaced are not covered. Cosmetic items are not covered. General maintenance items are not covered.

Health insurance companies these days are paying for preventative care in order to keep future, larger claims down. But that's not the case for warranty companies - if it ain't broke, there's no coverage. They don't pay for preventative actions that might save them money later.

Be aware of the ""Consequential Damage"" clauses. Many RV extended warranties exclude ""repairs of covered parts caused by failure of non-covered parts"" and ""repairs of non-covered parts caused by failure of covered parts"". These are ""Consequential Damage"" clauses. These clauses can cause denials of large claims, so it might be wise to look at optional ""Consequential Damage"" coverage if it is available.

If you aren't sure whether something should be covered and it is a concern, ask before you buy.

3. Perfom routine, manufacturer-recommended, scheduled maintenance.

A service center can do this or you can do it yourself, but make sure you maintain records and receipts. Proper maintenance is actually a requirement of most extended warranty contracts and failure to perform the maintenance could result in claim denial. If you haven't kept records of your service and maintenance before the warranty purchase, definitely keep them afterwards.

4. Make sure your repair facility gets pre-authorization BEFORE doing any repairs.

Pre-authorization is a vital part of the service contract and it is YOUR responsibility to make sure your repair facility gets that authorization.

It's very important to work with repair facilities that have good warranty departments or personnel that are used to completing the proper procedures for warranty coverage. A good warranty person in a repair facility can make things go very smoothly and reduce the possibility of claims denial. He or she may be the most important person in the whole repair claims process.

Note: Sometimes larger repair facilities can be better for warranty services simply because they have dedicated, experienced warranty personnel.

Still, make sure you know that they get pre-authorization, and be sure you understand what your charges (beyond the deductible) will be if the repair facility doesn't get approval for everything they submitted to the warranty Administrator.

In some cases, the repair facility may accept what the warranty Administrator authorizes and waive the additional costs as it relates to the covered repairs. In some cases, the repair facility may charge you for the difference. Know where you stand before authorizing the repair facility to go forward.

Before we leave this section, let's discuss emergencies. Most extended service contracts have an exception to the ""Pre-authorization rule"" for emergency repairs. But coverage for emergency repairs is very specific, as are the procedures for getting reimbursed. So be sure you understand the emergency repairs provisions.

5. The warranty Administrator will pay what is necessary to complete a covered repair, but usually not for upgrades.

Your repair facility may want to use upgraded parts or you may want to have upgraded parts. In certain circumstanes, the warranty Administrator may cover the upgrade if there is a good, well-documented reason.

However, don't expect that kind of approval, and remember you always have the option of paying the difference for the upgrades.

6. Let the warranty Administrator inspect your RV.

If the warranty Administrator wants to have your RV inspected to verify the condition of the RV and determine if there are any pre-existing conditions, let them inspect. If an independent inspector chosen by the Administrator doesn't document pre-existing conditons, there is less chance of a claims denial on that basis. Also, sometimes the inspectors might bring your attention to a problem you were unaware of.

7. Try not make claims too soon after the contract purchase.

Warranty Administrators don't want to deny claims, but they have to be strict in their reviews in order to protect all the contract holders. Claims made immediately after contract purchase will automatically be under suspicion. Such claims will attract extra scrutiny. In fact, some contracts have short ""waiting periods"" (measured in days or miles), before a claim can be filed.

Of course a breakdown or parts failure may happen right after the contract purchase. Just be aware that it will automatically be reviewed with extra scrutiny. It's more likely an inspector will be sent out to make sure it wasn't a pre-existing condition, and your documented maintenance and service records are even more important.",camping

3073,1487777042.0,Can I sleep in a tent that hasn't been put up,"Sorry if this is a stupid question but I've never camped before. I am doing my first hitchhiking trip but I don't want the weight of a tent (and I'm flying with wizzair small cabin bag only) and can't afford a good bivy sack. I've come across a free tent so I want to know if I can sleep in a tent without stakes and pegs just using it as a sort of waterproof cover. 

Wondering if I will have problems with condensation, I can open up an umbrella inside or something to allow air to circulate.

Edit with more info about why I'm not buying a tent
1. Wizzair only allows a small cabin bag so my weight restriction is smaller than a 30L backpack for a 2 month trip- doable but not with a tent
2. I don't believe I can bring stakes and pegs on the plane
3. Will be used for emergencies and beaches/some nice spots in town (not woodlands)
4. I'll be doing a lot of walking with my stuff around towns and hitchhiking, I heard you shouldn't carry more than 10% of your body weight (4.7kg for me, and I'm not very strong so I don't like carrying too much) and a tent would bring my bag 4.5kg to 6.5kg. 7kg is alsolutely miserable for me.
5. If it's raining lots I'll book a hostel rather than sleeping outside
6. There's no walmart in my country
7. The only bivys I can afford have really bad reviews on amazon for being soaked with sweat in the morning
8. I have a light sleeping bag and tarp so I could just use that
9. I like being creative and working with what I have
10. Thank you for ensuring I don't suffocate on my holiday

Conclusion: leaving the tent at home, bringing my sleeping bag and tarp, will consider the bivy, thanks for your help!",camping

What did you expect when you were going to the park that's been booked out a month in advance?,"Imo people are going camping with unrealistic expectations. When you go to a park with 60 lots in sequence peak season it's not going to be the same as going off season or dispersed camping. I think people are setting themselves up to be disappointed. When we go camping you gotta be prepared for everything. Heat, cold, rain, drought, snow etc. But this doesn't just include gear, this includes preparing your mind. Know what you're getting yourself into and plan ahead. I hate seeing so many of you guys having such a bad experience when you go out. This should be an awesome time for you, don't let people piss in your cheerios


Edit: The way some of you guys are responding I don't think you understand what I'm saying. Yall taking this to mean it's OK to be a jerk etc. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying everyone knows what certain sites are going to be like during certain times. But yall still show up during those times and then act surprised.

3084,1694235523.0,Why are the batteries dead every morning?,"Edit::: to include this information for clarity.

The 2022 model camper came with these batteries. 

(2) Interstate SRM-27 Deep Cycle Marine/RV. 88AH. 160RC. 750MCA. 12V. They are connected black/black, red/red. 

The only thing operating is the fridge. And NO, it can not run on propane. It's 12v Electric (it's on a fuse, not a breaker). It's a GE model GPV10FSNBSB. 12VDC, 13.5amps.

The inverter is also drawing from the 12v system while in standby mode, so I will try turning that OFF at night.

We have the solarflex400i solar panel system (2) 200watt panels and a Xantrex Freedom X2000 inverter. We only use 120v outlets during the day when the panels are operating efficiently. Typically, as the sun sets, our batteries are at full capacity

:::::


We have a Keystone Bullet with two deep cycle lead acid batteries. They are connected by jumper wires. When boondocking, we use the installed solar panels and inverter to power the 120v system, but the water pump, refrigerator, cabin lights, slide out, awning, power jack and power stabilizers all run on 12v. 

The battery is fully charged at the end of the day, but by morning, the fridge is warm, freezer is thawed and the lights flicker. The water pump is sluggish. 

We can monitor the battery system and solar panels by apps, and the battery app will indicate slow but steady drops as soon as the solar panels are done working for the day. It also shows the amount of useage, and calculates how long the system will operate without being recharged. One thing I noticed was that it suggested a ""remaining useage time"" of roughly 10 hours. This would explain why by 7am, our fridge is getting warm and nothing works, but it doesn't explain why, and what could possibly be draining those batteries so quickly?!?!

Do we seriously need to move to Lithium batteries to boondock overnight? That doesn't seem right to me? All lights are off. No appliances are plugged in. The water pump is off. 

I've checked nealy every rv thread online, been to the manufacturers website and even talked to customer support. It's all circular talk with no solutions. The dealer will charge us $175/hr to evaluate, but they couldn't guarantee that they could discover the problem in an 8 hour day...

So, here I am, looking for the free advice.

First of all, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post, but I really have no idea what I'm doing and I need advice.

My girlfriend and I are 16 years old, and we each live with our parents, who are ALWAYS FUCKING HOME. To get alone time together, our solution has been to find a secluded spot in a forest near us and lay down a plastic tarp and a sleeping bag. This is nice and works fairly well, but we are interested in establishing something more permanent and cozy so I am exploring the option of having a tent set up full time that we can visit.

I really have no idea what I'd be looking for in camping equipment, so this is where I need some help. Obviously, portability is not a concern. But does the tent material have to be a specific kind of fabric for continuous exposure to rain for months on end? Does the tent need to have something specific about its shape and structure to deal with heavy snowfall?

Additionally, what would I look for in a location for the tent? It must be flat, obviously. But is it essential to be on top of a hill to prevent flooding, or in the shade to prevent sun damage?

Finally, what kind of maintenance would be required of a long term tent setup?

Here is what I'm currently thinking of buying:

* [RioRand Double Layer 2 Person 4 Season Aluminum Rod Outdoor Camping Tent Topwind 2 Plus with Snow Skirt](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00KGQ2PDI/)

* [OUTAD Waterproof Camping Tarp Tent Footprint](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B01HDBE2HU/) (do I even need a tent footprint?)

* [Ohuhu 86''x 59'' Huge Double Sleeping Bag](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00T4BHYLY/)

Are these good choices?

Additionally, I'm looking for the following:

* Good quality pillows to keep in the tent

* a good quality foam mattress type thing to layer the bottom of the tent with and increase comfort

* a sealable, scent-proof bag to store snacks in

Again, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing here so any help or advice is greatly appreciated. If someone has experience with long-term tent setups I would love to hear about that. Thank you for any help.",camping

3129,1481303060.0,My Scary Camping/Stranger experience,"First I want to say that I was not for sure to put this as a scary stranger encounter or scary camping story. Also I have a problem writing things so if it seems a little weird sorry about it.
Over this past summer I was camping with a couple long time family friends. For safety purposes I will call them Bill and Lauren. But thru out the whole previous summer Bill Lauren their kids and I went camping at their camp site. Also with us were Lauren‚Äôs twin sister Ashley and her husband Tom and their kids. 
We usually went there for every weekend that it was nice outside but I‚Äôm just going to talk about the day I had the scary encounter. To start from the beginning of the day we all arrived at the camp site about noon we had some fun while swimming in the pond that the camp grounds had but I couldn‚Äôt shake off the feeling that I was being watched from the distance beyond the tree lines. But I ended up not trying to think too much about it at all because I was having some fun while swimming in the hot Ohio weather. If you live in Ohio or ever spent a full summer day in it you will understand on how the weather patterns can be real stupid at times but it doesn‚Äôt get as hot as it does in other states that get it real bad thou. We all decided to get out of the water to get dried off because we were going to cook some meat on a grill before game 7 of the Cavs vs Warriors game came on. I happened to look near the pathway that lead to the camper that Bill Lauren their kids and I were staying at and all I could see was a man just standing there looking in our general direction and when he noticed I spotted him he ran into the trees so I was initially freaked out about this but I decided not to tell Bill Lauren Tom or Ashley. So we ended up grilling some steak and some other cow meat. We ended up getting a lot of meat because Tom works at a factory that does a lot with putting all the meats in the packages so he ended up bringing some of it with him to cook. So we got done eating about 630 and since the game didn‚Äôt start until 7pm I believe we all went to Bill and Laurens camper and started a bonfire. And just talked until the game on and we listened to the game on a Toms phone since we didn‚Äôt have a TV with cable. We all didn‚Äôt go to bed until a little after 11pm because we all stayed up to see who won and you all already know the cavs won sadly. So we all went to bed I stayed up until about 1130 because I like being alone for a little bit before going to bed so I watched the fire for a little bit. Before I went to bed I put out the fire so nothing really happens. I had to sleep in a tent outside because the camper that Bill and Lauren had was too small to put another person in there. 
So I ended up falling asleep when I got into the tent. I woke up around 2 am because I thought I heard something and I‚Äôm a real light sleeper. And after a few seconds of that weird feeling you get right as soon as you get up I realized that the fire was going again and so I sent Lauren a text asking if she was outside and happened to start the fire again or if Bill or any of the kid‚Äôs and she responded no and she thought I was still awake. I only sent her this because I saw someone standing near the fire and also the fire. When we both responded that it wasn‚Äôt us we heard a maniacal laugh. So Lauren called 911to get the cops to come and I didn‚Äôt really know what to do because I didn‚Äôt know if the person had a weapon or not so I decided just to try and wait until the cops showed up. Unfortunately, the person that was out their started to come near my tent and I was a sitting duck and I know what you guys think why didn‚Äôt I just run away when I had a chance to. For one I think the person would have gotten to me before I even made it out the tent because of how loud the zipper was to it. So the person decided to try and unzip the tent door so I decided to take the chance and kick the persons head when he went to get the zipper luckily it knocked the person back and the person stumbled down the hill that I put the tent on. Luckily I had a flashlight with me so I shined the light towards the person and found out that it was the man I saw from earlier that day. He started to charge at me and luckily I took some karate classes so I defended myself to the best I could. When I went to kick the man he grabbed my foot and threw me to the ground and luckily we could hear the cops sirens coming. The man decided to run into the woods area. 
I ended up telling the cops everything that happened and I‚Äôm not for sure if they decided to look for the man in the woods area and found him. Turns out he was just a creepy homeless man that was living near the woods. I still try and figure out why he targeted me out of all the other people that were at the camp sight. I‚Äôm just glad that my anxiety didn‚Äôt kick in. So creepy man I just hope that we never meet again.

3130,1411083198.0,I want to go spend a year in the wilderness. Away from everything. Please help me prepare properly.,"I have a ton of hiking and camping experience. I've been to almost all state parks and a ton of the national forests. I don't, on the other hand, have much hunting experience. I don't really know where to begin with this, as far as where I should go or what I should bring. I have a decent amount of gear. But, I think, most of it is more applicable to 3-5 day trips. Less long term stuff. I would really love to go to Alaska, because it has the largest national forests, but it is pretty far from where I am, so I think I'd like to stay in the lower 48.

I need the best way to find a small plot of public land. I'm aiming for something off the paths so no one stumbles upon me.

I need the best method to do laundry if I can't go into town on a given day.

I also need recommendations on offgrid electricity sources, [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca/) four season tents, sleeping arrangements, and the best kind of stove to boil water and keep my hands warm in the winter when I take my mitts off my hands.

Preferable to have this conversation in a chat window. The best things that could happen to me is to go through this process with someone who's familiar with offgrid camping.

50 y/o American here with two boys age 6 and 8.  I grew up in the rural Deep South with horses, four wheelers, hunting and fishing etc (though at the time I longed for the big mountains of the Rockies.)

My boys so far have only lived in the generic suburbs of various teeming metropolises - but like most boys they love to camp and ski at least in small doses.  I feel the urban environment sucking out my soul.  I assume it‚Äôs doing the same to them. 

I can retire with a government pension in 4 years. Thanks to living somewhat frugally, I have enough savings that I don‚Äôt have to work at the relatively young age of 54 as long as I live modestly.  I‚Äôm in good health and shape. 

I‚Äôve decided that life is too short to do what most of my colleagues do, which is to start a second career in the private sector and slave away after they qualify to retire from government service. 

My wife will continue to work, as she isn‚Äôt ready to retire. 

I used to  half jokingly say I was going to be ski patrol in the winter and a whitewater rafting guide in the summer while I was still fit enough.  Now I think that‚Äôs pretty indulgent and my thoughts are more about spending time with my boys and providing experiences I didn‚Äôt have.  I need to do it before they get too old and too cool to hang out with their old man.  

There‚Äôs got to be something better than them playing video games and me shuttling them back and forth to soccer practice all summer. 

What would you do and where would you go?  Rent a cabin on a remote lake in Alaska or Canada practice self reliance, then do it again each year. Thru hike for the summer? Go on epic canoe trip (where?)  Get them started whitewater kayaking (one of my old passions that I wish I had started much younger)? Etc. 

After summer is over we‚Äôd go back to my wife/their mom. 

I‚Äôm not adverse to buying property somewhere either that we could return to each year and that I might eventually retire too full time when they are out of school. 

TL:DR. Give me your suggestions on providing epic outdoor experiences for 11 and 12 y/o boys for a full summer.",camping

Now returning it would have cost 20‚Ç¨ for whatever reason which was I think more than it cost or similar  (just under 20‚Ç¨, max. 30‚Ç¨ (?)).

Don't worry, I never used it and got a proper one from Decathlon after asking staff loads of questions.

Now I'm decluttering my things and wondering what I should do with this thing. I'm thinking of just throwing it away and giving away the gas cartridges.

About the camping stove (pardon, idk the correct terms):

The blue metal is curved or simply not straight causing the whole stove to be not straight.

In yellow, the part where the gas goes through and turns into a flame. It is of two parts, the lower, and the upper with the holes where the flames would go through. That top part will never be fully screwed. It will always be a bit loose so the mechanism seems to be faulty too. If you turn it and you think you almost turned it to the end, it becomes loose again.

In green, those two parts are also loose and not safe to use at all. It does not sit on the yellow part. If you bump it, it will all collapse.

Is the yellow part even remotely safe to use? 

Should I just throw it all away? 

I included pictures of the gas cartridges. Are they safe to use? Is it safe to give them to someone? If not, where do I get rid of them?

1. Should I be worried about snakes or any creepy crawlies? Or animal of any sort?

2. How do people charge their phones while camping? We could charge while driving, but I imagine there will be days we won't be driving. Extra batteries can only do so much.

3. Do the bathrooms in the campsite have hair dryers? If it's cold and I wash my hair how do I dry it? Not thinking vanity, thinking health reasons and that I need to be dry to sleep in the sleeping bag.

I told the kids to stay away from it, but of course my toddler didn‚Äôt understand and despite my best efforts he went near it multiple times.

What could we have done? I reported it to the campground but they said they don‚Äôt spray poison ivy in the park. Does a campground have a responsibility to keep campsites free of poison ivy? Should we have sprayed it ourselves on day one? We were there for six days.

UPDATE: I am NOT going to spray in the campsite. I did not realize that spraying was such a big deal, which is why I posted the question about what to do in the first place.

3289,1688603779.0,A plea to the stoner primitive campers outs there: use WAG bags,"Twice in the last year (including this morning), my dogs have ingested human feces - unburied or lightly buried - at primitive campsites. Many people don't know this, but when you ingest THC (edibles) you actually shit out a lot of it, and it's still toxic to dogs. So, I woke up this morning to my dogs shaking uncontrollably, unable to control their legs, peeing on themselves, the whole nine yards. And this is the second time in 6 months.

Obviously id like it if my dogs didn't eat shit, but human feces is highly attractive to a lot of animals, and 90% of us don't bury our shit appropriately. I have been guilty of this myself. If you're eating weed and doing it though, you're sickening a lot of animals. 

So this is my plea to please use WAG bags. They're way more LNT and will do a lot more to preserve the ecology of the places we like to camp. They're also a lot less work than digging an appropriate hole.

For the sake of the animals, from a fellow stoner

Edit: for those questioning whether it was THC - and  who are still actually talking about the waste disposal issue - we did tests at a vet, dogs tested positive. We reconstructed the scenario for vets on both occasions, and in both instances they were the ones that provided the mechanism. I don't think we're at ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" level, but I think it's more than reasonable to claim this is what happened. I'm a big stoner myself and have nothing against THC, so quit acting like I'm attacking anyone. Beyond that, we don't even have to be talking about THC here. Could be any prescription drugs or whatever substance comes out of your ass that is toxic to animals. I just used THC because it's what happened to me, and there are obviously a lot more users out there these days. Anyway, there's another comment in here somewhere that gives some reporting of this happening in various places. Find it if you care",camping

Also they were doing something sounded like pressure washing at 3-5AM and at 6 they opened and started blasting music.

Can anyone tell me a better way to find a simple camping site?

Edit The site my GF found was  [Freecampsites.net](https://Freecampsites.net). It only listed Racoon Valley which was all RV's and a Walmart Parking lot. ",camping

3321,1627900831.0,Why don't more tents have darkened bedrooms?,"Got a large first tent earlier in the year which a darkened bedroom and it is an amazing feature. You sleep so much better when the bright sun is not making your entire living space really bright at the crack of dawn. 

I've been aiming to get a smaller, lighter tent I can put up myself for solo adventures with my mtb (not necessarily bikepacking, just more time at further away trails without having to pay for a hotel/airbnb every time) and it's quite annoying to find a tent that ticks every box other than having a darkened room.

Why aren't more tents like this? I'd have thought it would be an almost standard feature these days. Is it weight? Do most people just prefer to not have a darkened room?

I'm considering leaving it until next year to see if more good small tents have this feature.

Has anyone here tried DIY darkened bedrooms which I've read a bit about? Is it as much of a pain in the ass as I expect it be? Or even potentially trying to size up another tents bedroom with a darkened bedroom and buying that as a replacement part? I know there's the option of a sleep mask but it's not quite the same.

For what its worth, I was considering the Vango Knoydart 300 for its feature/size/weight, though the closest I can really find to it with a darkened room is a Coleman Chimney Rock 3 Plus which is considerably heavier (and larger).",camping

The wind all night was howling. I thought that the tornado from Nashville had made its way to Massachusetts. The wind was peaceful to sleep to, and I slept the best I had in a long time. I wake up the next morning, and am unusually chilly. My toes are shivering. I personally sleep better when cold so I shrugged it off and went back to bed. About an hour later I‚Äôm still cold. My hands felt like I had been sleeping outside all night. I grabbed an oversized hoodie, throw it on and get back in bed. 

At this point I glance down at my phone. I see a text from my mother dear. We had lost power overnight. I began laughing. Part of the reason I came down here alone for the night was, to see what living alone would be like. Would I like it? Would I get lonely? Could I maintain it all? 

Fingers crossed the power comes back on. But if it doesn‚Äôt, we will live out this adventure. I call it camping in your own house. My friends will be here later today & we can just camp all together. We can‚Äôt feel guilty if we eat too much take out, or spend too much money dining out because we just can‚Äôt cook. We can‚Äôt use the tv or listens to music. We can‚Äôt watch Netflix. We will just be shivering together with each other‚Äôs undivided attention.

Camping is a great way to escape from the ""real world"". It can separate you from the stress that you experience at work and home, giving you time to recharge. The article below is packed with useful camping tips that can be used in the future.

Always locate your shelter before dark when you are camping. Once darkness falls, it is very difficult to set up camp. That is particularly true if you aren't used to the blackness of the wilderness. Do not wind up in this position. Seek shelter and make camp for the night well before darkness sets in.

Make sure you have a survival kit with you during your entire camping trip. Survival kits should contain waterproof matches, a survival knife, a first aid kit, a flare gun and water purifying tablets. This kit can keep you alive! Carry it at all times.

Double-check any medical insurance. You may need an additional policy when you are traveling on your camping trip. This is even more of a factor if you travel to another country to go camping, like Canada. Be sure you're prepared to be on the safe side!

A bandanna or a handkerchief can be beneficial to bring on your trip. Such an item can be used as a carrying bag, a potholder, a hand towel, a blotter or a paper towel. It has a multitude of uses and should be an essential part of your camping gear.

The lint from your dryer's lint filter will help you start a campfire. Before you go camping, start saving lint from the dryer's filter. To make it easy to collect dryer lint, simply hang a bag next to the dryer and fill with your lint. Just grab your bag of dryer lint and go on camping day.

A camping trip is a fun way to spend time. It gives you the opportunity to bond with nature and relieve yourself of the stresses of your daily life. The advice in this piece will help you transform any camping experience into the trip of a lifetime.",camping

We're going to a state park, Pendernales falls, and I really don't know what to expect when it comes to how strict their going to be on rules. Any one with experience please give me some feed back! 

First off we plan on drinking. Obviously a campsite won't proudly display that underaged kids can get away with drinking but as long as we're not obnoxious and we just hangout do you think it'll be alright? We could always poor the alcohol into different containers but even then I don't think it would be difficult to figure out what were doing. A few of us do have fake ID's if there's any chance that would help. 

Secondly we booked the campsite awhile ago and at the time only 8 or us were going. One more friend joined and we went to book another campsite because of the eight people max rule but by that time there was no more open sites. If nine of us are there will they notice? Or more importantly will they care? The park also has day only entry so I was thinking a few of us could enter separately and  meet up inside. Incase you can't tell I'm grasping at straws here haha. 

The last thing I'm curious about is the quiet time. I saw that state parks have a quiet time between 10 p.m. And 6 a.m. I was wondering, in your experience, is that rule typically followed. I wouldn't want to be a disturbance to any fellow campers so if it is we'll happily oblige but once again just trying to figure out what to expect.

3393,1694164323.0,Camp cooking on a budget with minimal equipment.,"I do 3 or 4 day trips camping, about 8 times a year. I have minimal cooking equipment but not looking for suggestions to buy any equipment outside of $30 range. I have a 'camp' cooking pot, my kitchen spoon fork and knife. Tent camping with usually 5-10 minute hikes to the campsite. Favorite campsite has a walkin boat launch that I portage my canoe to. 

I'd like some ideas for food outside of what I currently am bringing. Time spent cooking at camp isn't much concern, I only travel about 5 hours a day. Camp cooking ability, equipment, and budget is though. Packing equipment for food is minimal outside of zip locks atm.

Cheap means I fit the stereotype of a male that has lived alone for 20 years. Anything ingredients outside of basic spices and condiments at home would mean they need to be bought. Can probably be afforded but won't be used outside of a backpacking trip. Any ingredients will probably never be used outside of a backpacking trip.

Price and prep is a concern. Google searches seem to be upper class or for long trips. Keep in mind I'm doing most of my treks eating hot dogs, beans, tuna, tortillas, and some vegetables currently.

Places I go almost always have a firepit and a grate. Access to plenty of firewood and water is never an issue. I don't travel far each day so typically spend most of my day at camp.

3399,1686540502.0,Jaffel irons don't fit bread any more and that is an actual conspiracy,"This is a pet peeve of mine that has become an source of petty but sincere frustration, and I came here specifically to have a (good-natured) rant about it.

It is impossible now to buy a new jaffel iron that isn't far too big for the bread, meaning it fails to clamp and seal the edges, and every jaffel is a messy, hands-burnt-by-boiling-cheese, beans-in-your-lap experience. They don't cook properly because the sandwich in the iron is completely unconstrained in all dimensions. The jaffel in the iron is like PC games in the 2000s where you got an A4 size box containing one loose CD in a plastic sleeve. The jaffel isn't held fast against the heat-transfer surface, and the halves go into misalignment from the first time the jaffel is flipped. Upon opening, the top half is more likely to stick to the iron than to the corresponding half, tearing the jaffel along its critical latitudinal axis. The jaffel cannot be released into the camp bowl by the usual sideways suspension followed by a little shaking, because even gentle agitation will tear the loosely constructed abomination apart.

I have heard theories that this is due to shrinkflation of sliced bread dimensions. Do not believe this crisis-denying propaganda. I have compared newer irons I have bought to my parents' irons I used as a kid and the new ones are 10--20% wider and thicker to a similar degree. What's more, to buy an older one (whether square or my personal favourite, round), they are either second hand 'antiques', or hipster 'craft' items, both difficult and expensive to attain. No, no, NO, this is not ok. We need to able to go into a regular camping store and purchase a jaffel iron that can actually create the eponymous priduct, utilising slices of bread not baked by a being living at the top of a magical beanstalk.

The true mystery here is, *how did this happen*?! The humble jaffel preceeded and inspired the modern toasted sandwich, and modern sandwich toasters cleary are designed to produce a more technological version of what once was the noble jaffel. So the world of production and manufacturing *KNOW* the criticality of effective edge-sealing to create the perfect jaffel yet somehow the free market has not taken care of it for its more wholesome campfire-genic ancestor.

This is, therefore, some kind of conspiracy. Either the government or the corporations who own them are somehow limiting the market's ability to supply us with this critical product. I suspect it is maybe electrical kitchenware companies trying to monopolise the two bits of toasted bread with anything inbetween market, or perhaps a foreign power trying to disrupt our sense of national identity.

So, me and a couple buddies planned a 3 day trip to Kawartha Highlands last summer to end off the school year. We planned it two days before the trip giving us just enough time to figure out transportation, gather the food, tent, canoe & tools... The morning of the trip it was already off to a bad start, my friends were supposed to meet me at my house by 9 in order to mount the canoe and pack the only ""Car"" we could borrow, a (4 person Chevy Sonic), we ran into some issues and eventually but eventually hit the road at 11:30 with a 12foot aluminum canoe barely strapped to the roof and a car packed to the brim with luggage, food and people.

&#x200B;

After some gnarly traffic and nearly killing ourselves over a dozen times, we arrived at the lake, and boy was it bigger than it looked on the map. We get out of the car and take the Canoe of the roof, only to find one of the foam sliders we used to mount the Canoe was gone, luckily we were fine and we proceeded to see if the bloody thing would even float (luckily it did, kinda). So we packed up and started paddling to site that we thought was about a 2 hour trip away, wrong. After nearly killing each other we arrived to our site about 5 hours later with about an hour of light to spare. We packed up camp, made some ""food' and went straight to the tent to smoke and drink some... (I'm gonna stop here for legal reasons lol).

&#x200B;

To keep things short, we packed up the next day and headed another 5 hours out of the park. There were a few more hiccups (Tornado warning, Friend bailing out, Friend getting lost, Arguing, Canoe almost sinking...) but we were alive, and made a lot of great and not-so-great memories.

Just how susceptible are down bags to losing insulation when wet? I understand down of course loses all of its desirable qualities when wet. But how wet are we talking? I live in Alabama, where it is not uncommon to get a torrential downpour. Obviously that hopefully won't happen while camping, but it is a possibility. Am I straight up screwed if that occurs? Or is it more a matter of ""dry off before you get in the bag""? The bag I am looking at in particular is the Nemo Disco. It is nylon, so I don't know if that provides some protection from moisture for the down.

To answer a few questions you might have:

* I don't mind spending the extra for down if it is straight up better.
* I don't have any backpacking trips planned, but I will like to do it sometime in the future.

First you pick your camp choose the approximate area you want your camp to have.  This is the easy part.  This should be done your first night for reasons that become obvious. Start with the most obvious trails into camp then mark your territory.  Piss away. Do this the first day, if no other campers around, and night.  Piss all around the area you want in your camp.  If one of your campers is a big beer drinker, let them in on it.

\- stretchiness/flexibility of a guy line? (adding a small stretchy cord to one or both ends?)

\- taughtness of guy lines

\- stakes, length angle in ground, shape?

\- ground conditions (rocky, muddy, dry, frozen, etc...)

all of these thigs will have an impact on the tent, how they deal with forces, constant wind pressure and sudden gusts. weight of rain/snow etc...

Was just pondering something here.

Considering that we all know how to attain shelter, stay warm, find water and make it safe to drink, make a camp fire, etc.

AND we all have a ton of gear to help us do those things...

(Not to mention the first aid kits and medical training many of us have)

How much more capable are campers to survive a difficult time if the world took a bad turn,  than an average person that doesn't camp as a hobby and have a bunch of camping gear?

Note: What got me thinking about this was the cold weather in Texas recently, when the winter storm happened, people died because they simply couldn't stay warm.

A problem that most of us could have solved simply with a tent and a sleeping bag. 

Maybe even a Mylar blanket, a fire and some wool socks if we really needed to...

Then I began thinking about how the homeless population often turn to tents and camping equipment to survive as well...

I'm an avid camper, and have been for a while. I like to think that I am pretty camp savvy and like to uphold park rules because I believe they make sense and are in everybody's best interest.  

That being said, I do break one. I bring my dog on trails that forbid dogs.  
  
My understanding is that dogs aren't allowed because they can intimidate wildlife and other campers, and they can go off trail, and they poop indiscriminately.  
So... I hike with my dog. He's 6.5 lbs, he loves camping, I pick up his poop, and he never leaves the trail (or my side).  
I know it's not fair and that maybe some people think I'm acting ""above the law,"" but the truth is my dog just likes the hikes and I don't feel like I'm harming anything or anyone by doing it.  
Is it so wrong? 
  
I have been to many backwoods trails with him, and only at one location did I have any negative reactions by fellow hikers.  
I just want some perspective here!  


EDIT:  
I see people are quite heated on the issue. I appreciate the constructive feedback! I will definitely be spending more time looking for trails that he is allowed on, and be more cautious about bringing him to areas where predators and wildlife are more susceptible to his impact. That being said I do not believe that ""rules are rules"" and will operate as well-informed as I can be (which is why I posted this!) and act accordingly. Thanks for the input!

* I have a 0 degree down bag that I plan on using, I will obviously be sleeping off the ground. 
* I also havy a buddy heater that I can use in the tent and I'll be keeping a window open for ventilation. I'll also have a carbon monoxide detector for extra safety. (tbh i'll probably turn it off before going to bed, to be extra cautious).
* Cell service is good where I'll be
* Lastly, I am going to have bear mace (are bears around this time of year).

My normal go-to for this is the AMC and the white mountains.  Unless I plan on bushwhacking in the national forest (something i'm not keen on doing), I'm very nervous about free-camping wherever there's some trees and a little open space.

We were kinda bummed at first, but during our last portaging trip I started to appreciate the lack of camp fire. Obviously in the summer it's not needed for warmth, cooking over a campfire is fun but actually not very practical especially on long trips. But we had so much more time in the evening because we weren't mucking around with fires or cleaning up after them. And the peace and quiet and DARK of the woods is so nice. You can hear and see more wildlife. The fireflies are brighter. But still, we always missed marshmallows, that hanging around a fire chatting etc

Then last week we went camping with family. We were thrilled there was no fire ban because a couple of the kids we were taking had never gone before and we wanted them to experience it. 

Within an hour of nightfall I was done with fires. The whole campground was covered in smoke, you couldn't see anything, you could feel the air quality getting worse. In big campgrounds, everyone lighting fires all summer long must have a negative effect on the ecosystems we're supposedly there to enjoy and protect. And there aren't nearly enough rules about fires imo. Obviously fire bans are easier to enforce, but some idiot must have been burning plastic or something other than camp provided wood on one of our nights because the smell was horrendous.

Anyone feel the same? It seems like it's a completely ingrained part of camping culture here, I wonder if we'll ever move to just expecting everyone to have fewer and smaller fires.",camping

3630,1694349744.0,Tips for making tent poles out of wood dowels,"Recently, I've started using a tarp for shelter and I'd like to make a couple tent poles out of wooden dowels that I can pack away with my tarp. It is easy enough to find a stick to use as a pole, but I'd like to make something to keep as a permanent part of my kit. I could buy a collapsible pole, but I want to make them.

Have any of you ever made your own tent poles? How did you do it and what did you use? I'm thinking about using hardwood dowels and some type of pipe connector. I'd like to make 2-4 poles that are about 4 feet long and have interchangeable sections that can be used to vary the length of the pole set. Maybe making each section 12-18 inches (30-45 cm). 

What are your ideas, or what have you made?

Edit: These poles will not be used in a dome tent and will not need to bend. I guess ""dowel"" has different meanings to different people. So to clarify, I'd like to use a wooden set of oak poles to make a collapsible set of oak poles. The diameter is still up for debate.

Edit 2 (The Great Bamboo-zling): Bamboo is a great material and is actually slightly harder than oak. However, bamboo has some serious drawbacks for the use intended here. First, bamboo is incredibly flexible and strong... when it's green. Once bamboo dries, it becomes hard and brittle. Think about a sailing ship's mast, if it were made of green bamboo it would bend all over the place. And, if it were made of dry bamboo, it would snap and shatter. The poles I'm trying to build are kinda like a ship's mast, except they won't need to bend anywhere near as much as a ship's mast does.

Edit 3: I have never heard of anyone using bamboo for anything other than gardening or decorating until today.",camping

The construction fencing worked for a while but it was very difficult for me to get in the ground and then I must not have done it properly LOL because they could just lift the bottom up.

 . . . how should I say this . . . 

- be able to hold my head up high
- be able to look up at the stars
- etc. with security and not fall over to the side. 

This makes it slightly difficult to find pairs that do what I need them to do in the front without giving me wedgies in the back. I also really need to feel the band in the crease where my leg meets my pelvic bone. 

I'm legitimately OCD, and anything else will make me literally incapable of doing anything. However, I *really* like merino wool ever since trying a shirt and socks, and I'd like to switch to merino for underwear. But the only pair I've tried yet was Woolrich's boxer briefs, and they definitely didn't fit the bill on either point. ExOfficio briefs in small work almost perfectly, by the way, if that's any reference point.

3670,1693077012.0,Jaded Camper,"I wanted to go camping this weekend. I haven't gone camping for years. I saw this really neat tent that attaches to my SUV online and it really inspired me to get out there into nature but also have the safety and creature comforts of a vehicle. I was pumped and bought a lot of gear and fun stuff to do while out there, all by myself\*.

I reserved a spot about 40min away from my home right by a lake. The place I had reserved was in an area that many people speak lovely about with fond memories from that past. -So I couldn't go wrong!- I was so excited and wouldn't shut up about camping by myself this weekend when talking to my coworkers and I know they are going to be asking me about my experience come Monday morning...

\-IDK? I guess every time I have gone camping in the past, someone else (parents/friends) had already known the place we would go to and camp. We would go to a place and be left alone to do fun stuff without much of anyone else being around. I wanted to be ""alone and far away from society and commune with nature or something""? 

I showed up at the spot after being lost for about 20mins and I guess I had passed it 2 times already thinking the road leading that way was for RVs only. I am so jaded. The National Parks website stated the area I booked was for ""tent camping only"" and that you could also park your vehicle close to the site you reserved. Or something of that nature. 

It was almost all RVs and it was brimming with people. It was like Times Square on New Year's Eve mixed with a poorly constructed refuge camp and some trailer park BS to the mix. It was loud, obnoxious, and in no way ""alone and far away from society and commune with nature or something""? 

I would like to know what I did wrong. I paid money for a site that ended up much worse than staying at home in my apartment. What do I need to know in order to avoid these situations? 

Can I find a place to get with nature? Or is this what ""Nature is now""?

Lunches: sandwiches, cheese, crackers, fruit, tuna/chicken salad, soup if its cold, etc.

Dinners are where it gets complicated. I usually make burgers, hotdogs, sausages, chicken breasts, or fish on a campfire. The Coleman stove is mostly reserved for stuff that needs to be boiled or just warmed up like those packaged rice or pasta side dishes from Uncle Ben's or Lipton or whatever.

Would it make sense instead of making just a fire pit, to  create a circle about 15 feet wide(if you have the clearance) of logs, bark, twigs etc of fire with maybe a 45-90 degree opening on one side. I'd imagine a lot of the animals that might attempt to come towards you in your sleep will be repelled by the mostly ring of fire, and the little opening would be enough for you to walk in an out of as needed.

Again I've never gone camping so if you think the idea is problematic try constructive criticism.

&#x200B;

**Truffle Mushroom Risotto:**

Turn your camping pot into a vessel for a creamy and luxurious risotto.

* Ingredients: Arborio rice, vegetable broth, dried wild mushrooms (porcini or shiitake), fresh mushrooms (cremini or portobello), truffle oil, white wine, shallots (finely chopped), garlic (minced), butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.
* Instructions: Rehydrate the dried mushrooms in hot water. In the pot, saut√© shallots and garlic in butter until fragrant. Add Arborio rice and toast for a minute. Deglaze with white wine and allow it to absorb. Gradually add vegetable broth, stirring constantly until the rice is creamy and cooked. Saut√© fresh mushrooms separately and add to the risotto. Stir in the rehydrated mushrooms, a drizzle of truffle oil, and grated Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

&#x200B;

**Lemon Herb Salmon with Couscous:**

Impress yourself with a flavorful salmon dish accompanied by fluffy couscous.

* Ingredients: Salmon fillet, lemon, fresh herbs (such as dill and thyme), couscous, vegetable broth, butter, asparagus spears, salt, and pepper.
* Instructions: Season the salmon fillet with salt, pepper, and lemon zest. In the pot, melt butter and sear the salmon until cooked through. Remove and set aside. In the same pot, bring vegetable broth to a boil and add couscous. Remove from heat, cover, and let it steam. Meanwhile, blanch asparagus in boiling water. Fluff the couscous with a fork and stir in fresh herbs. Serve the salmon on a bed of couscous with asparagus on the side.

&#x200B;

**Coq au Vin Inspired Chicken Stew:**

Transform your pot into a rustic French-inspired chicken stew.

* Ingredients: Chicken thighs, red wine, pearl onions, mushrooms, carrots, chicken broth, bacon strips (optional), garlic, thyme, bay leaf, flour, butter, salt, and pepper.
* Instructions: In the pot, cook bacon until crispy. Remove and set aside. Brown chicken thighs in bacon fat. Remove chicken and saut√© pearl onions, mushrooms, and carrots until slightly caramelized. Add minced garlic and a sprinkle of flour. Stir to create a roux. Deglaze with red wine and let it reduce. Add chicken broth, thyme, and bay leaf. Return chicken and bacon to the pot. Simmer until chicken is tender and flavors meld.

&#x200B;

**Berry-Pecan Breakfast Quinoa:**

Start your day with a gourmet breakfast quinoa bowl.

* Ingredients: Quinoa, almond milk, mixed berries (blueberries, raspberries), toasted pecans, honey, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and a sprinkle of edible flowers (optional).
* Instructions: Cook quinoa in almond milk for added creaminess. Stir in vanilla extract and a pinch of nutmeg. Serve in bowls, topped with mixed berries, toasted pecans, a drizzle of honey, and edible flowers for a touch of elegance.

Live in Denver CO and am looking for a family camping vehicle. Not extreme off-roading, but definitely 4x4 and high clearance to get to trail heads and dispersed camping. No Subaru or other CVT.

* To get where we are going we often drive between 3 hours and 8-ish hours (depending on traffic). So a comfortable ride. Decent gas milage would be great, but I'm already willing to give on this.
* We have a newborn so safety is very important. LATCH for the car seat is also required.
* We also have a golden retriever and need some space for her. Also want enough space in the back for camping gear + baby gear. Likely 3-4 14 gal HDX boxes + 3-4 duffel bags plus some recovery gear, blankets, chairs, and pillows.
* Will most likely put a RTT on top, but leaning toward a SUV over truck to have the option to sleep in the back too.

And we'll the *tent* I grabbed from Walmart was actually a little fucking sunshade cover that looks like a fucking tent but isn't. It's a glorified fucking tarp with walls missing and no bottom. 
So I get to bellow the spot I'm hunting at i eat some summer sausage and pineapple and I go to pull out my *tent* and realize this. 
The sun was already setting and there was no chance I could get back to town in time. So I just had to make do, figured I'd be fine. After it got dark and I was trying to close my eyes and I hear sumthing stomping around. Now that's not spooky but it was enough to keep me up longer. Then again I heard something stomping a little while later a lot closer to me then last time. Scared the shit outta me and got me wide awake for a few more hours. 
Now I'm chillin, it's 1:49 am about 2-3 hours tell sunrise and things get bright again and I've already encountered twice a bear growling noise. Realizing I can only pull the trigger once while holding the light in my other hand I'm determined to stay up till then.
So let's recap triple check allllll yo shit. And fuck whoever though it was a good idea to make a shitty little fucking sunshader *tent*. And fuck Walmart for selling this peace of shit.",camping

I've wanted to go camping for a long time and it feels like I have the perfect opportunity now. 



I've become a lot more adventurous with my newfound freedom than I was during my school days. Been hiking and cliff jumping for a while now and spending a night outdoor is next on the list. 



My plan is still to go solo cause I can't find like minded people who are willing to spend as much money as I am on getting all the right camping gear.  The physical and psychological dangers of going alone don't scare me. I like the solitude. Solo hiked 20kms a day so I think i can make the trip.
 


The only problem I'm seeing is that I might be filling up my dorm room with way too much crap literally and also putting more than I can handle on my plate. I don't waste my time lazing around; I do have academic aspirations that I follow when I'm not thinking about all this. People go to college to focus on studies while I spent the entire sem thinking about all sorts of possible adventures to be had. Also, I got a pretty good GPA so not like I'm sabotaging myself in the academics area.



There's nothing really stopping me from going but there's no saying I won't regret it later. Think you could manage it solo? Thoughts?",camping

3765,1530304726.0,6 Reasons Why You Need To Take A Hammock When Travelling,"Many people are embracing the use of hammocks in their outdoor living and adventures. If you are yet to jump on this bandwagon, let me give you 6 reasons why you need to put a hammock in your backpack next time you are travelling.

**1.** **The absolute outdoor relaxation**

The hammock gives you a chance to relax outdoors. Using tree-friendly super straps, you can hang it on the beach and enjoy yourself without the bother of the sand getting into your clothes! A peaceful and relaxing nap when hiking in the woods simply requires a quiet place to hang your parachute hammock. 

**2.** **It has lots of uses**

The parachute nylon material that the camping hammock is made up of makes it a versatile item that you should always carry when travelling. It can come in handy wherever you may be. You can use it as a blanket, a picnic mat, a pillow, sunshade or even a backpack cover during light drizzles. 

**3.** **Offers cheaper accommodation**

Having a camping hammock is just like carrying a tent, only much better. Find yourself in a hotel or hostel with no more room? No worry, for a small fee you just need a small space to hang your hammock, and you are good to go! 

**4. much better sleep**

Sleep therapists and doctors advise one to sleep on their back for quality sleep. There is no other way other than this to sleep in a hammock. The gentle swinging of the hammock will relax you and before you know it you are soon asleep! Sleeping in a parachute hammock is also much more comfortable than in a sleeping bag on the hard ground. 

**5.** **Easily portable**

The parachute hammocks are lightweight and fit easily in a bag attached to it. This makes it very portable and can be carried everywhere. Compared to the bother of carrying a sleeping bag, you will love taking your hammock with you.

**6.** **Make friends easily**

The presence of a hammock surely attracts many people who want to try it out. A double-size hammock will give you a chance to make friends easily and have the joy of sharing with others. For hotel owners, hammocks are sure to pull people who would want to camp in your grounds.

Next time your adventure bug hits you, don‚Äôt forget to throw in your hammock in the car trunk. You never know when an opportunity will come calling for you to use it. You don‚Äôt want to miss that, do you?",camping

3808,1685588641.0,Bear safety?,"What do you all do with your food when car camping in a dispersed location?

I‚Äôve lived in Colorado my whole life and never had a dangerous bear encounter, but I‚Äôve been camping more often lately and realizing the odds go up each time üòÖ. I understand that bears that are familiar with people are able to break into cars pretty easily, so I get paranoid about storing our food in the car. As my boyfriend said, ‚Äúbetter the car than us‚Äù, but ideally we could avoid a bear totaling the car.

I know that hanging your food is the most common solution, although I‚Äôm wondering what this looks like if you have a lot of food (a big cooler and/or bin). How do you all store your food to keep it safe from bears? Are there bear-proof containers that are fairly large and can hold a decent amount of stuff?",camping

3810,1685321218.0,What checked bag/luggage are good for solo mixed camping trips?,"Hi, I'm looking for gear suggestion on how to carry camping gears on mixed trips that ranges somewhere between 4 and 12 days.

The trips I'm looking at would involve sightseeing in cities, taking public transportations in between, and few nights out in some national parks. I'm also carrying some photography gears including few lens and tripod.

It'd take a checked bag for flights to fit the gears. So far few criteria I figured out are: 

* Camera, lens and electronics will stay in a backpack with me, so no much need for the checked bag to provide protection for them.
* There should be wheels to make it easy to drag. With the use of public transportation (without driving a car), large backpack or duffle bag we be physically too demanding to move around.
* camp sites often require few or teens of minutes of walking on unpaved or gravel roads, so typical spinner luggage with tiny wheels wouldn't be easy to drag on those terrains.
* somewhat water resistant or even waterproof in case it rains when camping. I guess I could always wrap it with something for that.

Anyone in similar situation that'd share their solution for those? 

Thanks!",camping

I have an autoimmune condition where if I get sick, it‚Äôs very serious and I could be hospitalized at the drop of a sneeze.

We are having some construction at the house and my partner thought it would be fun to just get away and go camping. I picked up a new (cheap) sleeping bag at REI today. I was just going to wash it, as I wash all new things, but my partner stopped me and said I can‚Äôt wash my sleeping bag.

Unfortunately, we are headed out tomorrow (the camping trip was a last minute idea) so, I can‚Äôt just sit and wait for whatever germs/bacteria/etc to dissipate before use. And it is surely germy since it‚Äôs from the REI store and the sale is on and the store was crazy crowded and not everyone was masked. But maybe the outer bag protected it??

Not sure what my options are. It‚Äôs an utterly cheap Kelty synthetic sleeping bag to replace my old 1980s flannel one, which I had as a child and washed all the time and it was fine.

I absolutely understand not washing a fancy $300 sleeping bag and ruining it. This was $35.

In a few weeks I am going wilderness camping **alone** except for my labrador. I will be on the eastern side of Huron National Forest, nestled up against the Au Sable.

I know there are black bears in northern Michigan and definitely in Huron National Forest. 

I'm getting very apprehensive about my trip. I think I'm blowing it out of proportion, regarding bears.

This seems to be the best place to ask what the consensus is. I've read that black bears are timid and typically run away if they hear a person, I read about standing up and talking calmly. I know not to have food in the tent or scraps around the site. I've got bear spray and a .357 magnum with bear loads.

I was thinking of doing push pull legs split, using equipment that is easy to pack away and store. Here is the equipment I was thinking of taking:

* Suspension trainer/TRX
* Resistance Band
* Sandbag
* Sandbell
* Mat

Here is the workout I was thinking (spread over 3 days):

**Push**

* Sandbag/Sandbell Floor Chest Press: 3 Sets
* TRX Chest Press with Resistance Bands: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* Sandbag Overhead Press: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* Sandbell/Resistance Band Lateral Raise: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* Sandbell Tricep Extension: 3 Sets x 10-12 reps

**Pull**

* Resistance Band Rows: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* Sandbag Deadlifts: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* TRX Rows: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* Sandbell Bicep Curls: 3 sets x 10-12 reps

**Legs**

* Sandbag Squats: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* TRX Squat with Resistance Band Rows: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* Sandbag Lunges: 3 sets x 10-12 reps
* Sandbag Hamstring Curls: 3 sets x 10-12 reps

**Cardio**

* Hiking
* Surfing

I will probably change the rep ranges/sets depending on how I'm feeling but just wanted to add it as a guide.

Does anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on the workouts above? Is this something that is great in theory but won't really work in reality?",camping

I want to start this by saying that we are not disrespectful A-holes. We believe on leaving no trace and don‚Äôt want to have a negative impact on anyone else‚Äôs trip. Regardless, we do all still want to stay up till around 2am drinking beer playing games and listening to music without worrying about bothering our neighbours.

We plan to go midweek in early may to aim to avoid school holidays. The Peak District is ideal because some of us are in Manchester and some are in Sheffield but I‚Äôm not dead set on it.

Some of the criteria were looking for in a campsite are:
Parking within a mile
A train station not too far away so we can do a trip or two to pick people up
Shower Facility‚Äôs aren‚Äôt necessary but would be very appreciated
W/C Facility‚Äôs
A nice country pub within a few miles
Woodland area is a big bonus but not essential

So if anyone has any recommendations or advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",camping
