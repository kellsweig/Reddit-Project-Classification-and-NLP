0,1697288848.0,Better pillow solution?,"I currently have the sea-to-summit Aeros ultralight pillow and it is not high enough for side sleeping and gives me pressure headaches if I lay on my back. I’ve tried like 5 different pillows and stuck with this one because it’s the tallest in height. I’ve tried putting my fleece under the pillow but that doesn’t add much height. Recently, l went backpacking with a friend that had the same as me and I stacked two together(somewhat deflated) and it seemed to be a solution. It was high enough and the pillows didn’t slide off one another. Not sure about the pressure headache on the back of my head.

2,1697260255.0,How to Catch and Cook a Crappie UL,"I am currently practicing my fishing skills, so I can eventually catch and cook a crappie. What would be the most lightweight way of cooking this? I have a Toakes 750 ml + Soto Windmaster setup, so I'm thinking I could filet the fish with my filet knife, put the fish in a food-safe freezer bag, boil water and pour it into the freezer bag, then wait a few minutes. I could either drink the crappie soup with the crappie or carefully pour out the hot water and season with some salt and pepper. Are there any other better ideas or recipes? I don't want to add any other pan/pots to increase my current setup weight, and I prefer cooking only water with the Toakes, because I hate doing dishes while backpacking. Thanks.",Ultralight
3,1697255468.0,Path Projects Killam PX Pants Review (vs. OR Astro Pants),"This is a review of the Path Projects Killam PX Pants and a comparison with the OR Astro Pants. I purchased both on my own and am not affiliated in any way with either company.

# TL;DR

I prefer the Astro Pants for my Fall hiking trips in New England. I use Killam PX Pants for regular workouts in Eastern Ontario in the Fall, Winter and Spring, and into the Summer if the humidex is below about 90°F (32°C). The Killam PX Pants win big in two places: durability and waist band.

# —

I've used the OR Astro Pants for about 200 trail miles of Fall hiking, mostly on the Appalachian Trail in Maine and in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

I've used the Path Projects Killam PX Pants for about 30 trail miles of Fall hiking in the White Mountains, and for at least 6 months of regular workout sessions including urban running and stairs with a weighted pack.

**Durability**

The Toray Primeflex fabric is impressively durable. The 30 trail miles in the White Mountains included all the usual rock and tree abrasion you'd expect in the Whites. Add on to that about 400 km of training runs, plus about 15K feet of vert training (stairs with a 50 lb pack). After all that use over these past 10 months, I don't see any signs of wear on my Killam PX Pants.

Compare that to the fabric of the Astro Pants, where after my first 70 mile hiking trip I saw extensive pilling of the fabric underneath my pack's water bottle holsters, along with numerous pulls and snags in the fabric from all the rock/tree abrasion. On my most recent trip I noticed a new pull or snag in the fabric at least once a day. That said, after 200 miles the Astro pants are definitely worn but they are still going strong.

**Length**

My size Large Killam PX Pants have a 28"" inseam, with a tapered leg. The leg opening is stretchy, so that one's foot/heel can easily pop through, but they also have 7.5"" ankle zips so you could pull these on without removing your shoes. The taper of the pants will sometimes get stuck on my calf muscles (15"" around... I don't think I have huge legs!) but will usually come unstuck on its own. That's less of an issue if I'm wearing any layer underneath the pants, and wasn't noticable when hiking.

My size Large Astro Pants have a 30"" inseam, with a tapered leg. The leg opening is stretchy, so that one's foot/heel can easily pop through. I find the inseam and leg taper on the Astro Pants to be just about perfect.

If there is one thing I would change about the Killam PX Pants, it's this. I would keep the same taper but extend the length by at least an inch. And now that I write that, I see they advertise a 29"" inseam on size Medium and I wonder if they've lengthened the new year's model.

**Waist Sizing and Waistband**

This is one thing that Path Projects get very right. I have a 35"" waist, and the sizing of the waistband on my size Large pants is perfect. I find the waistband on these pants to be excellent, and I like the drawstring implementation.

When I am training, I keep the drawstring in a tied-but-loose position. I don't need the drawstring tightened to keep the pants up, even when I'm running with my phone in the back pocket. When I am hiking, I carry quite a bit in my front pockets, and I do tighten the drawstring just a touch.

The sizing of the waistband on my size Large Astro Pants is a touch too large for my 35"" waist. When I am hiking, I *must* tie the weird OR drawstring implementation (honestly... WTF is that!), or the pants will be dragged down by the weight of what's in my pockets. The drawstring cannot be tied at all without making the waistband fold and bunch. If there is one thing I would change about the OR Astro Pants, it's this.

**Pockets**

The Killam PX Pants have two zippered front pockets, a zippered rear phone pocket, and two zippered rear small pockets (that are maybe useful for gels or something?) The front pocket openings are just a smidge too small for my XL-glove-wearing hands. The front pockets are just a smidge less deep than I'd like them to be... they do manage to hold all my stuff. The rear phone pocket I don't use while backpacking, but while training it's just barely big enough to hold my Samsung Galaxy S22.

The Astro Pants have two loveley, perfectly sized, non-zippered front pockets. They perfectly fit my XL hands, and perfectly hold all my stuff. I've never once lost something because it fell out of my front pockets while I was hiking. The Astro Pants also have a zippered back wallet pocket that I've never used.

My pockets load-out while hiking includes my phone in a waterproof case (8 oz), a baggie of hygiene supplies (soap, balm, etc. about 3 oz), and my paper map (1 to 2 oz). It all fits into the Killam PX Pants, but fits better into the Astro Pants.

For my training, I honestly don't find the Killam PX Pants pocket configuration to be that useful. Wearing something like the [T8 Sherpa Shorts](https://t8.run/products/m-sherpa-shorts), I can carry my phone, keys, emergency rain shell, and even two soft water bottles. Maybe Path Projects are thinking that you'll be wearing a vest or a belt if you want to carry that much?

If I could change a second thing about the Killam PX Pants, I'd make the front pockets a touch deeper and their openings a touch larger. And TBH, I'd lose the front pocket zippers.

**Moisture Management**

This is the reason I keep choosing the OR Astro Pants for my Fall hiking trips in New England.

The scenario is high exertion hiking (e.g. climbing Mount Washington via the Tuckerman's Ravine Trail) in steady light rain, in temps around 10°C (50°F). In these wet, super humid, high exertion conditons, there's really no way to not be soaked. I chose to be soaked with sweat underneath my poncho. My OR Echo shirt quickly saturated with sweat, and all that moisture then flowed down to onto my pants. Between the rain and the sweat, my pants became saturated as well.

I've been in this scenario wearing both the Killam PX Pants and the Astro Pants.

The Killam PX Pants become very heavy with so much moisture. So much so that I had to tighten the drawstring to keep them from being dragged down. The pants feel wet to the touch.

The Astro Pants fabric handles the moisture, dispersing it better. The pants feel damp to the touch, not wet, and they do not become so heavy that they are dragged down.

Probably not a problem in the arid west.

**Wind Resistance**

The Toray Primeflex fabric is fairly wind-resistant. My usual winter running attire has three layers on my lower body, to avoid frostbitten appendages. The Killam PX Pants are wind-resistant enough that I was able to head out for an hour's run at a wind chill of -20°C (-4°F) with only two layers on my lower body.

I've been hiking in a breezy 0°C (32°F) wearing alpha leggings underneath my Astro Pants, and that was fine.

**Gusset**

The Killam PX Pants are not gusseted, but I have never found that to be an issue, even in some of the rock scrambles in the White Mountains. The Toray Primflex fabric is every bit as stretchy as advertised.

The Astro Pants do have a gusset.

**Feel**

The Toray Primeflex fabric is significantly stiffer than the OR Astroman/Ferrosi fabric. This isn't an issue or even really noticable when active, but I would never reach for the Killam PX Pants as a lounge pant (Path Projects do specifically call out loungability in their marketing copy).

I actually do sometimes reach for my OR Astro Pants as a lounge pant... the Astroman/Ferrosi fabric is just so smooth and comfortable, and the front pockets are just so perfect.

The Toray Primeflex fabric is stiff enough that it abrades away the hair on the outside of my calf muscles if I am not wearing any layer underneath the Killam PX Pants. I've never had that happen with the Astro Pants.",Ultralight

**Day 1 – 5.4 miles – 480 feet gained –** We departed Pittsburgh at about 11:00 AM and stopped at the last service plaza on the turnpike for a meal at Roy Rogers (food selection in this area is unfortunately limited). We drove through Burnt Cabins and down Aughwick Road into Cowans Gap and parked next to the beach area. The state park facilities were unfortunately closed, but the park was fairly busy.

We departed the lot around 2:30 right onto the Tuscarora Trail heading north, which in this section had lots of day hikers on the easy gravel grade. It headed across the dam and made a right, following Little Aughwick Creek/Aughwick Road to the right and Cove Mountain to the left. We passed a few trails that headed to the left, which headed straight up Cove Mountain (Horseshoe Trail, Fox Trail, etc.), but Tuscarora remained a gentle grade, which allowed us to get into camp at a reasonable time. Finally, the trail banked right and crossed the road right where Todd Trail hits it, and then crosses Aughwick Creek on a nice bridge. This wouldn’t be a bad spot to improvise a camp, and we debated doing that (it would also lessen how much we would have to retrace our steps) but decided to continue on the 1.7ish miles to Burd Run Shelter.

The trail follows an old logging road in this area, which continues its steady ascent from the creek. A couple trails branch up to Tuscarora Mountain to the right, including the Ellisec/Ellisic Trail. This trail is about 0.6 miles from the shelter and has a small creek that you could collect water at if necessary. It was relatively dry when we went, but there was still enough flow that it should be useful year-round. We also passed the Silberman Cabin to the left, which had a couple cars parked at it, so it’s hardly the most isolated area. We arrived at Burd Run Shelter which is set up 50 or so yards above the trail to the right, on a sloping area. The shelter was much nicer than expected, with a picnic table, an outhouse with toilet paper, and a fire area. The only thing missing is a water source, of course. My friend was going to use his tent, but there were not any flat areas at the site (only down by the trail), so he slept in the shelter. I slept in my hammock, which was slightly chilly but comfortable.

**Day 2 – 13.9 miles – 2,500 feet gained –** We woke up around 7 and took our time breaking camp, making a nice warm breakfast and coffee. We left camp around 8:45 and backtracked down the trail back to the bridge at Little Aughwick Creek, where we planned on filtering water for the day. When we got there, we realized we were both having issues with our Sawyer filters; we have a couple theories on why (it’s probably stupidity) but should have checked their functionality before we left, so we were left without any water filtration from that point, which was obviously an issue. We collected water and started to boil it, as we had no other alternatives. At this point my fuel canister ran out, which was another dumb move, but at least my friend had his full canister. I managed to fill up a liter for the day, and my friend got himself about two full liters, so we weren’t in bad shape. I knew with the cooler weather I would get dehydrated but able to manage. We lost probably 45 minutes in this process.

We continued back across the road until we got to Todd Trail, and took a right. The sign said it was 1.4 miles from there to Standing Stone Trail (although I marked less). We steadily ascended for a time until the last 0.5 miles or so, and then had a steep ascent up the trail with a couple switchbacks until we got to Standing Stone. We took a left and remained on top of the narrow Cove Mountain ridge for about 4 miles. This section was pretty slow going, as it could be very rocky at times and we really had to check our footing. Several spots offered views of Allens Valley to our left and “The Cove” to our right, especially as you near Knobsville Road. The going is quite easy once you get onto Knobsville Road, and several day hikers with dogs and kids were ascending from Cowans Gap. There’s a couple view points as well into the state park.

We continued descending the ridge down Knobsville Road (which is more like a wide trail) until we arrived at the South Logging Road Trail. The trail is really easy in this section, so we were able to make good time, although there’s not much for scenery. At the Peffer Trail we were supposed to turn left down to the road; however, I was confused because it traveled through some camps’ back yards, so we continued on until the logging trail ended, and then bushwhacked through the woods to get down to the road. Right where we came out to the road (so near the Peffer Trail turn) happened to be a spring (which you can see marked on some older topo maps). It appeared to be an old springhouse, as there was some stone built up around it. I was low on water myself, so I decided to fill up before our bigger climb. My friend is more conservative than I am when it comes to untreated water, so he decided to skip it.

We continued down the road past Richmond Trail (which I suggested for shortening the day), but we decided to continue on, as the ascent of Richmond would be pretty gnarly. We made the right at King Trail, which is gated, but has a bridge that crosses Little Aughwick. This is another old logging road. The trail bends to the north on a gentle climb before bending back south, at which point it continues up the ridge, supposedly for a view. We continued on the old logging road to the left until it seemingly ended abruptly. There were a couple fenced plantings and some marshy/boggy footing, but we continued through so that we could connect to Lockard Trail (if you went a wetter time of year, I would avoid this section and just continue on the road, skipping King Trail entirely). We kept going until the opening ended and followed a game trail through the woods to Lockard Trail, which we continued straight on. Lockard Trail was more forested, but still easy as it followed Little Aughwick. We got to an old/falling sign for Fore Trail that pointed to the right up the ridge. That section of trail appears abandoned, although it’s still marked on the official trail map. A little bit down Lockard from there we arrived at the other side of Fore Trail and made a left there.

Fore quickly ascends up a dry (at the time) stream bed. As we approached Aughwick Road it got quite steep. Once on the road, we turned right and immediately continued up Aughwick’s steep ascent for about 0.5 miles. We were quickly tiring at this point. It flattens out near the top of the mountain and has an interesting highland ecosystem that’s relatively treeless. It reminded me of Dolly Sods. Finally, we got to Ernie Gish Road which is an abandoned road that still has some gravel. We turned left here and gently descended (with some nice views of the valley) another 0.75 miles until we got to the Big Mountain Shelter to our left.

This was one of the nicest backcountry campsites I’ve ever been to. The shelter was even nicer than Burd Run, with seemingly newly veneered wood flooring. The nearby pond is fed by a spring just above it (if you’re really adventurous you could maybe find the source), but we just filled up from the feeder creek and boiled. There’s a fire ring next to the pond as well if someone was already occupying the shelter space. I opted to sleep in the shelter this night, as it was supposed to get colder than the previous night and I was concerned about the wind.

**Day 3 – 5.0 miles – 550 feet gained –** We got up a bit later, but still made a warm breakfast and coffee. We broke camp at 9:30 and hiked 0.6ish miles up Ernie Gish and Tuscarora Trail to the Big Mountain Overlook. Some people were already there for a morning view, as you can drive right up to the viewpoint. This is probably one of the best vistas in all of Pennsylvania. We went back down the way we came to the Tuscarora Trail. The trail gently declines on top of the ridge as Ernie Gish Road for a couple more miles. You can peak through at some points to the valley to your right. Once we hit Geyer Trail, we re-entered the state park, and the trail became rocky and narrow once more. The descent became steeper as we went from here, until it started switching back several times back to the state park proper. It followed the road into the state park a little until we were back at our car. It was about noon, and I had lunch at a picnic table before we headed out.

**Final Thoughts –** This was a really cool and challenging loop. I’m happy to have done it in a cooler time of year, as those couple ascents were pretty difficult. I wish I could have gotten there when the leaves were a little more changed, but there were still lots of beautiful viewpoints. The shelters were excellent, and I wouldn’t change anything about using those (I was concerned they might already be occupied, but that turned out to not be an issue). The only thing I’d really change is to be more careful about the gear I bring (filter and fuel canister).

**Gear –** I used a pretty standard setup for myself. I opted for my inflatable mattress instead of my new underquilt because I thought I might end up in the shelter, which ended up being the case. I brought an extra quarter zip which came in handy both for hiking and at camp, which I layered with my down puffy during the cool evenings and mornings. My 20-degree quilt was borderline, but mostly fine. The only things I didn’t use were my rain jacket, flip flops, and shammy towel, which I ended up not needing because this was a relatively dry trip. I used my frameless pack, which was a nice light option, but included the hip belt (I still feel like I need to get my base weight down for this). The only other big weight penalties were food (I made a couple fancy meals) and a couple flasks of whiskey (really helped with the cool weather at night).",Ultralight
5,1697214012.0,Appalachian Trail Gear shakedown request,"Hi all.  I'm just in the early process of finalising my gear for my NOBO AT thru starting in early April.

I have also been worrying if I will be warm enough in a 30F quilt in April. To start I will bring an Alpha Direct 120 fleece, an EE Torrid puffy (will send the puffy home probably in VA) and some lightweight joggers. But I'm considering adding some Alpha Direct 90 MYOG leggings (\~80g) to the setup (I'll also likely send them home along with the joggers in VA).

**Budget:** $500

**Non-negotiable Items:** 1) Tent**:** I see the extra few hundred grams for a 2p tent as a luxury. Also on my previous AT hike, I had no issue finding spots with the larger footprint of a 2p tent, although maybe the trail has gotten busier since 2019? 2) Umbrella: could maybe be convinced to not take this however whenever I don't take mine on a trip I end up wishing I had brought it.

I've used this on trails using trekking poles and the tube stays put and doesn't move. It's easy enough to move around if it does get snagged while bushwhacking. The only problem is the shock cord may leave a mark on your hand from the shock cord compressing, but it's not uncomfortable, just looks weird. My shock cord was kind of tight so maybe I should make it a bit longer and it wouldn't leave a mark. The weight with shock cord is 12g total. I've made one of these for my wife and she liked it too and it stayed put on our hands. The picture should be self explanatory how to attach to your hand. I like the tube.

I am a diabetic and I was wondering if any of you all had ideas/recommendations for rapidly digestible sugary food items that are low weight.

Right now I bring a bunch of pure organic fruit bars which are about 22.2 carbs/oz but didnt know if there was anything better. Bringing like 40 of these things adds up in weight (25oz) and if i go on a more strenuous/longer hike i could potentially need even more (exercise uses a ton of carbs, who woulda thought)

  
Another idea i had was to just fill my hydration pack with gatorade or an electrolyte drink instead of water but, thats not ideal if my blood sugar is fine and im just thirsty or at camp and not needing the extra sugar (also its impossible to know how many carbs im taking in to keep track)

10,1697149864.0,Shivering and feeling cold,"Not sure if this is strictly ultralight but I figured you guys would know. Apologies if it's too far off topic.

I hiked across a section of desert last year, 20 miles a day for a few weeks with a few days off in between. I really struggled to sleep at night because I was shivering and felt freezing. A bit delirious as a result at times. I assumed I was just pushing the ultralight a bit too far with a sleeping bag liner and a plastic bivvy bag with no insulation and temperatures must have been lower than expected.

So I bought a sea to summit spark I and walked the Cotswold Way in the UK this summer with that in a hammock. I was shivering and cold again at the end of each day and all night even when I bedded down with the sun still up and my phone saying it was well over 20C (68F).

So I don't think it's temperature / insufficient kit, but perhaps it still could be if it's normal for body temperature to drop post exercise for hours and then my kit isn't enough for a night outside? Thought it might be sugar or salt related.

I've started training to head off to the desert again, ran about 10 miles today and I'm shivering at home in the warm. I've eaten very well today but not had much to drink until now, less than a litre. Yet I can't find anything suggesting this is a symptom of a little dehydration.

Ive been slowly working on shedding my base weight and am looking for some suggestions.  I just got myself under 20lbs by ditching my beloved Atmos 65 for a Durston Kakwa 55.  Next plan (when i have more funds) is an x-mid 1 Pro to shave an additional pound.   Once ive done that, ill still be at 16.5lbs base weight.  Im having a pretty tough time determining what else i want to ditch to get to 12lbs and still retain some comfort.

Hiking goals:  I hope to do the JMT and potentially sections of the Colorado Trail next year.  I also plan to go do some hiking in Argentina in the coming years.  Probably no longer than 2 weeks at a time but with a long term goal of a full thru hike one summer.   I want this pack out to be able to take me well into shoulder seasons (hence necessities such as low temp pad and sleeping bag)

Things I plan to change when funds allow:

\-X-mid 1 Pro - 19oz savings

\-Katabatic 22deg quilt -  15oz savings

\-Lighter stove - 4oz savings

TOTAL:  2.37lbs savings

&#x200B;

A few things that im feeling pretty stubborn about are:

\-Chair - 20.8oz - Crazy Creek (ive been convinced to remove the chair!)

\-Medical kit - 11oz (heavy i know but im an EMT and value having some additional pieces that most wouldnt carry)-

Tensor sleeping pad - 14.8oz - this thing makes me enjoy camping outdoors.  Sleep quality is well worth the weight to me.

The footprint is there for cowboy camping, not the tent.

&#x200B;

I feel i have too much clothing (4lbs) but i cant really see how to thin it by much.  I can reduce the quality of my rain shell but that doesnt feel wise.  I already ditched my thermal underwear with the plan to just sleep in all my other clothes if its freezing.

Any thoughts and guidance will be greatly appreciated.  Happy to provide any additional info i may have forgotten.

14,1697004419.0,Shakedown for a first Thru-Hike? Te Araroa January-February 2024.,"**Location/temp range/specific trip description:** South island of New Zealand, on the Te Araroa. Either doing the full 1300-1400km or hiking 1000km to Queenstown and going home or doing day hikes depending on how we are doing for time (45 hiking days). Water shouldn't be an issue but we will have an 8-10 day food carry.

I have done a lot of 1 - 8 day trips but never a thru-hike. My partner has done a thru - the Colorado Trail last year. 

**Goal Baseweight (BPW):** At home (Vancouver Island, PNW Canada) I can just slide under 10lbs in the summer. I was hoping for the same here but I think 13-15lbs might be more realistic as I pack for a wider temperature range.

**Budget:**  Open -- I do not think I'll replace any of my big items (tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad, backpack) but open to anything else.

**Non-negotiable Items:** Pillow - it sparks joy. My rain jacket would be a target to cut weight but I really like the Outdry material as it doesn't wet out, and this model has pit zips. I would buy a lighter model of Columbia Outdry if I could find one but that hasn't happened. I do own Frogg Toggs but that is not what I want to wear on the top of a mountain in a rain storm. 

**Solo or with another person?:** With my spouse. I have included the items he carries at 0g, I carry the tent, stove, water filter + pot (and sometimes fuel) for us in return and he generally carries some of my food in return. This does make my base weight higher but my actual carry weight lower. 

**Additional Information:** I am torn between backpacks. I'd like to bring my 36L Kumo but I haven't done anything over a 5 day food carry in it, and we will have a single 8-10 day carry as an outlier to a bunch of short 3-5 day carries. 

I really like using a water bladder with my GG Mariposa as I have T-Rex arms and have trouble grabbing a bottle out of the sides/like to drink while moving. With my Kumo, I'd use two water bottles in the strap pockets. I like wearing my Kumo more and it is lighter but the 8-10 food carry is a lot. My partner uses a 40L backpack so he could not take much extra for me. 

We have a Katadyn BeFree and the Platypus Quickdraw; can bring either if that affects water carrying suggestions. No interest in a Sawyer squeeze due to slow flow rate and impatience. 

I have some light things at 0g but I wanted to show I hadn't forgotten that I will be carrying them. 

**Lighterpack Link:** https://lighterpack.com/r/kos2mv

I suspect the easiest cuts will be in water carry, replacing the strap on my headlamp, and not packing too much clothing.

**Other:** I am not packing this on the trip but I am bringing an extra pair of shoes and an extra set of poles to send partway down the trail as the cost of replacing them in NZ is very high. Any other suggestions of gear to mail down the trail?",Ultralight

I'm doing a long 6 month hiking / exploring trip around Patagonia, Africa, and India where I'll be doing a lot of multi-day hikes with a load range of \~22-28 pounds ([Lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/qxn75v)). Think lots of 1-6 day backpacking trips. I'm going as ultralight as possible for those and am considering the [Hyperlite Mountain Gear Junction 55](https://zpacks.com/products/arc-haul-ultra-60l-backpack?aff=8) and the [Zpacks Arc Haul Ultra 60L](https://zpacks.com/products/arc-haul-ultra-60l-backpack?aff=8). I love the Arc Haul's fit on my back with the full frame and currently prefer it to the HMG.

... I also do some occasional mountaineering. Been to Rainier and I think either of these packs would have been OK on the mountain, assuming I took decent care of it.

I plan on doing some smaller mountaineering trips in the future, like Shasta or Whitney Mountaineers Route or maybe a volcano in South America. Nothing super technical, but definitely adding some weight with rope/harness/axe/crampons/helmet. I currently have a 90L North Face and a 30L REI pack and neither of those works well for smaller trips. The 90L is huge!

The 55-65L size is so perfect for smaller mountaineering trips. Would love to reuse one of these packs if I could - they're so lightweight and waterproof.

I’m in the market for a four season tent and mainly have it narrowed down to the tarptent scarp 1 and big sky chinook 1 plus. 

They have a lot in common in terms of weight, fly first setup, the ability to run as more of a bad weather 3 season tent or get beefed up with added poles, and the edges can all be pulled up to improve airflow… 

The scarp is cheaper and looks to have a more protected entrance, while the chinook looks quicker to set up, looks a lil taller in the headroom department, and should have less issues with sag due to the pole structure (at least that’s what I’ve read). There’s also the scarp ultra which mitigates any sag issue though…

Hi,

Recently got a platypus quickdraw for my long distance hikes. I used it for the first time for a 36-hour 2 night trip, and it filtered approximately 6L of water in this time. No freezing temperatures.

Once home, I did an integrity test and found the filter to produce a stream of air bubbles on one side - according to the instructions, the filter is now defective and should not be used.

WTF!? 

These things are advertised to filter 1,000L of water, but after 6 mine is “defective” and now I need to fork out another £40 for a new one?

Like I said, the filter experienced no freezing temps at all and was only used to filter 6 litres of stream water.

Does anyone have a good tent recommendation? The three person tent was a little too snug, so we'd preferably take two 4s. The selection at this size seems limited unless you spend north of $800. Open to ideas and personal experiences, maybe it's best to pack a bunch of single man tents? I really like the specs and stuff sack of the MSR Papa Hubbard NX 4 but it's discontinued.

28,1696794184.0,Tent dilemma,"I am planning to hike the PCT in 2025 and am in need of a new tent. I am mainly going to hike in Europe and below the tree line. However, I would like to take a few trips to Norway, the Alps and Patagonia, where I would likely camp above the tree line in rather rough conditions.

I am looking for a two-person tent, as I like the extra space for solo trips and would like to have the space for a second person to join me in the future. It might be important to note that I am about 187cm (\~6'2'')tall.

The tents that have sparked my interest are the Duplex, X-Mid 2 and X-Mid Pro 2. I would like to go as light as possible, aiming at around 5kg total base weight, staying reasonable regarding pricing. I wouldn't justify spending hundreds more if there is only a small weight difference.

&#x200B;

The Duplex seems like the best option as it is extremely lightweight and generally considered to be a great tent. I would justify spending the price for good quality. The only downside of the Duplex as I see it is, that it does not perform well in high winds or above treeline conditions.

The X-Mid 2 seems to be very good in those conditions with the added bonus of being much cheaper. However, this comes at the cost of being double the weight of the duplex.

Is the X-Mid 2 pro the best of both worlds? Lightweight and good in rougher conditions? The downside of this tent is, that it is not currently available (I know that the new drop will be released soon, but there is no certainty as to if I can get one).

Another option I have thought about is buying the Duplex for hikes in good weather and buying another tent for rougher conditions. Possibly the X-Mid 2, as the extra weight would not make that big of a difference for shorter trips. The downside is that I would have to buy two tents, which is more expensive than buying just one.

My questions:

1. Which of these options would you suggest? Maybe you even have a bit of experience.
2. Is the X-Mid 2 pro good in rough weather? Have you had experience with it in Norway, the Alps or Patagonia?
3. If I do decide to go with the option of buying two tents, what lightweight tents would you recommend for rough weather?
4. Maybe I am missing something, so feel free to add your suggestions.I have been thinking about this for quite some time, maybe overthinking it a bit. I just want to make a good decision when I am spending that much money.

Pros: more durable 20D fabric, no stitching, 2 way zip which is great, hood. Considerably warmer EN temp rating for the same weight range. Cons: Zip stops at the footbox, reviews are mixed and some report a weight around 1400g+ which is really not ideal.

Enlightened Equipment [Convert 20 Apex](https://enlightenedequipment.com/convert-apex-custom/) 1022g, 335 USD paired with an EE torrid hood 68g, 70 USD brings the totals to 1090g and $405. Pros: Separate hood, full length zipper opens the footbox. Cons: Separate hood, much more expensive system, and the less durable 10D fabric.

Cumulus [Progressif -5c](https://cumulus.equipment/intl_en/synthetic-sleeping-bag-progressif.html) 1230g, 254 USD. Pros: Full length 2 way zip opens the footbox. Cons: It's the heaviest on paper, and has a lower temp rating than the MH Lamina

&#x200B;

Use Case: 3 season conditions in New Zealand (&  winter trips with extra layers to supplement warmth). It's mostly a typical mountain climate in the NZ South Island, with hot and dry summers in the mountain rainshadow, with often warm and wet conditions in the North and West. It gets cold (below freezing) in summer in the alpine areas, and I'm often camping above the treeline. Long trips will often include both very hot nights, and very cold and clear (or wet!) conditions with nights at or just below freezing, so longer trips usually see me carrying 3-season insulation, even in summer.

Why not a quilt? I presently own a down EE convert 20 and a cheap Mountain Equipment +5 deg bag and find that being able to fully close the bag when it's cold makes a big difference, as does having a hood, I find I really miss a hood on my EE convert. I happily lay it over me quilt-style on warm nights.

Why a synthetic? I sleep cold and I can't stand the way down always collects at the ends of the baffles, no matter how dry the down is, and how much I evenly distribute it around the bag (the convert has longitudinal baffles) there are always very noticeable cold spots that keep me awake. My down bags always seem to suffer from clumping as condensation affects the bag, it's never disastrous, but it really makes the cold spots even more of a problem.

&#x200B;

The EE and Cumulus both use climashield apex which is a continuous sheet of insulation, and the MH uses Thermal Q [https://backpackinglight.com/forums/topic/76982/](https://backpackinglight.com/forums/topic/76982/) which also appears to be a continuous sheet, I imagine that this should eliminate the cold spots that I find such a massive pain.

I'm not sure if the MH temp and weight ratings are accurate, whereas it seems EE are fairly good in this regard. Does anyone have experience with MH's temp ratings and listed weights or the Lamina eco 15 bag specifically?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Currently having a bit of decision paralysis, but it really comes down to whether the MH Lamina really weighs 1090g, or if the company is misleading in this regard.

35,1696710800.0,Motivation for ultralight backpacking from an ultralight-curious,"I’m curious, as a beginner backpacker (I’ve backpacking a few times but last time I went was 2015) evaluating some of my gear purchases / some replacements, and since I last went backpacking ultralight seems to have exploded as a market and as a category. I know it was there before, but nothing like it seems now. That had me wondering: what motivates you to be an ultralight backpacker?

Is it the simplicity? The challenge? That when you’re thru-hiking your food is so heavy, you really need your gear to be light? That hiking itself is more enjoyable? 

I’m dealing with some health challenges that make the possibility of having an extremely light kit more likely that I’ll get out backpacking, with the need to be more comfortable in certain ways. 

Just curious to learn more about folks motivation, whether you ever backpack in a non-ultralight kind of way, what kind of things you’d recommend to a beginner looking to get back into backpacking and who I suppose I would say is ultralight-curious. 

I’m not looking for gear recommendations, I think I’m more looking at approach-to-buying gear recommendations or what advice in general you’d give someone who is new or curious. 

Especially interested if you’re also in my boat, where certain health or physical limitations might make ultralight backpacking be more compelling, balancing with the reality that there will be certain areas you can’t compromise on. Flair as skills because I think ultimately deciding to be an ultralight backpacker at all needs it’s own skills I suppose. 

Thanks for any and all responses.

Edit to add: just want to say how much I am enjoying and appreciating so many responses. It’s really amazing to understand the wide variety of motivations, experiences and so on that also resonate with my own experience.

36,1696693005.0,Tent for human and medium-sized dog,"Alright, I’m finding I’m stuck here and haven’t found this particular dichotomy in past posts: I’m trying to get a tent for me (5'10"", 190lb male) and my dog (55 lb Aussie). I’ve landed on either the SMD Lunar Solo or Durston X-Mid 2p, but am open to other options. We’re largely hiking in the Upper Midwest (Superior Hiking Trail, BWCA) so humidity is something to be mindful of.

My requirements are a $200-$400 budget, sil-poly fabric (I’m assuming that’s the best fabric for the budget and have yet to be convinced otherwise), enough room for me and dog, and fully enclosed (dog has to be contained over night without the aid of a leash). I have my pad and quilt, and he has his own pad/space in the tent. He does usually end up cuddling with me, but he also likes to just lie on his own pad with paws fully outstretched.

Lunar solo looks solid because it’s 26 oz. and has that sweet little dog-sized nook. Relative to the Durston, it requires more effort and thought to set up and select a site, and it’s single wall. I am just about certain my dog will brush the inside of the wall at some point and get things wet. Or maybe I’m wrong? Anyone have experience? 

I also briefly looked at the SMD Skyscape Trekker, which would help with condensation given its hybrid design, but I don’t think it would fit me and dog. Am I wrong?

I love everything I’ve seen about the Durston tents. It’s probably the easiest trekking pole tent to set up, roomy, and quite light for all it provides. But with the 2p, it’s 9-10 oz more than the Lunar and almost certainly more space than I need for me and my dog.  It is however double wall and would limit condensation getting into the tent whenever my dog inevitably brushes a wall. Though with all the interior space, maybe he won’t brush the wall at all? If I thought we could fit in the X-Mid 1p, I would go with that and call it a day, but I’m not convinced it has enough space.

Is there any thing I’m overlooking? Am I putting more priority on the comforts of a double wall than I should be? Is there another tent I should be considering given my constraints?",Ultralight
37,1696649596.0,Thru-Hiking/UL Backpacking with Ostomy,"I have a health condition that recently required an ileostomy to be performed. While having an ostomy is not a limiting condition in many ways, certain care does need to be taken to ensure the stoma is protected and clean and that discharge can be managed during active pursuits such as backpacking. 

I haven’t seen any posts about this. I’ve seen some posts about backpacking with a CPAP machine that can unfortunately add multiple pounds to baseweight. Ostomy bags, on the other hand, are generally lightweight, comprised of medical paper/plastic/adhesive (almost like a specialized bandage). Plus, the bag is worn weight, unlike the CPAP. 

Here are my initial thoughts for THEORETICAL ostomy care on longer hikes based on what I have been taught. This is NOT medical advice:

1. Maintain good health and fitness and carry a light pack to prevent a hernia. Stay in good shape during the year so hiking season doesn’t catch you unprepared. Keeping baseweight low will stress your core muscles less. Stay well hydrated to the extent possible. 
2. Wear a neoprene or similar light compression support belt (worn weight!) to further prevent hernias and protect the stoma and bag from rubbing/chafing/sweat. This item should still be compatible with wearing a fanny pack (though depending on location of stoma on your abdomen and configuration of the fanny pack, YMMV). 
3. Use hipbelt-less packs or packs with narrow hipbelt wings to avoid rubbing or damage to the stoma (again, depending on location of stoma on your abdomen and configuration of the hipbelt, normal hipbelts could be an option for some folks). 
4. Ostomy bag contents can and should be emptied into a cathole like pooping the “normal” way (though perhaps may be more frequent) so a good trowel is needed. After discharging , the attached bag can be reused multiple days before being changed, but the opening must be cleaned before resealing. I think the lightest setup of cleaning the bag opening would be done using a small (3”x3”?) reusable microfiber cloth and touch of soap and water, with the waste water from cleaning the cloth/hands also deposited into the cathole prior to burying. Or possibly just rinse the bag opening with clean water (using Smartwater bottle/sport cap)? Or just pack TP/dehydrated wipes to clean up, but that adds weight as well as carried trash weight and possibly odor issues after use. 
5. I see the trickiest part of the whole process to be replacing the bag and cleaning the stoma, which is required every 3-5 days or as needed if leakages occur. This timeframe lines up well with resupplies/town stays on most popular trails, and no specialized equipment/supplies are required beyond adhesive remover (which can be purchased as single use wipes) and small scissors (which are typically included in first aid or gear repair kits). Replacement bags/supplies would have to be shipped ahead to town stops, which may require additional logistics, or be carried, which yields a weight penalty of a couple ounces per replacement set. But even on longer resupplies (7-10 days), the bag could be replaced on day 1 (morning before leaving town), on day 6 in the backcountry, and then on day 10 (evening after arriving in town). The preparation of the new bag and replacement of the old bag doesn’t need to be done in a sterile environment (you can shower with an exposed stoma!) but should be clear of dust and debris to make sure the bag properly adheres to the skin around the stoma and no irritants are present on the stoma/skin/adhesive. A hotel room or even a decently clean park/restaurant restroom would be great, a dusty-ass Duplex in howling wind less ideal. But I can envision common backcountry environments where a bag replacement could be quite easily done, especially with aid of a partner or friend. 

Like I said, this is a recent change for me so all of these ideas are theoretical. Has anyone here with an ostomy thru-hiked or LASHed? Any recommendations or corrections to the above? Or any suggestions of additional resources I could check out? Thanks!",Ultralight

39,1696626026.0,iPhone vs Android Phones: how is battery life in battery saver mode?,"I've been using my current phone (Samsung Galaxy S20 FE) for almost 3 years now, and I absolutely hate it. The battery life just isn't great while backpacking, and it's just an underwhelming phone.

The Pixel 8 just came out, as did the iPhone 15. This has intrigued me to consider changing my phones, with the hope of improved battery life (main interest) + features (better camera, AI, etc.)

I'm mostly interested in improving my battery life, as my current phone just feels seriously awful.  Given where we're at in 2023, I'm considering:

* iPhone 15
* Samsung Galaxy S23
* Pixel 8 (using pixel 7 statistics as no one has a pixel 8 battery test yet)
* Sony Xperia 10 V

I've made a [cool spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jMHLQhNozveJqx9MhyLExUstrGjVEkke/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117954400930989746232&rtpof=true&sd=true) comparing phone specs, and have a calculated a weight penalty if I were to make the phone have comparable longevity to the iPhone 15 by making up the difference through adding in additional external battery capacity.

From this, I have an effective on-trail weight as follows for ""equivalent"" run times:

* iPhone 15: 6.02 oz
* iPhone 15 plus: 7.4 oz
* Galaxy S23: 6.15 oz
* Pixel 7: 9.59 oz
* Pixel 8: 9.25 oz (estimated)
* iPhone 14: 6.71 oz
* Sony Xperia 10 V: 4.56 oz

The battery tests and assumptions were all normalized using the [Tom's Guide battery results](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/smartphones-best-battery-life,review-2857.html) (+ some scaling to try and estimate the Xperia for a Tom's-equivalent test).

I think I can't make a decision until I get real battery test data from the Pixel 8, as right now most folks are speculating it's similar to the disappointing performance of the Pixel 7 (which is still better than the Galaxy S20 FE I have).

**Where that leaves me:**

The Sony Xperia is a seriously compelling phone, although it seems a little underwhelming on the camera front compared to the S23, Pixel 8,or iPhones?

Other than the Xperia, it seems mostly like the iPhone 15 vs Galaxy S23 performance is going to be pretty comparable.

However, I've never used modern iOS phones in the backcountry, but am familiar with Samsung. Specifically, my main lingering curiosity is with the ""battery saver mode.""  Samsung (and android in general) allows you to go into extreme battery saving mode, where you can limit the usable apps to only a handful. This effectively quadruples the battery life on my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE in the backcountry.  **Does anyone know how iPhone's battery saving mode compares to Pixel/Samsung?** Or how the Samsung/Pixel battery saver mode compares to Sony's?

If the iPhone's battery saving mode is not comparable (or as effective), then it makes the Pixel 8 a reasonably compelling candidate.

46,1696516105.0,Help with sleeping setup for a couple with a copper spur UL3 long,"Hi folks,

My SO and I are looking to increase our backpacking/camping as a hobby going forward.

As such, I’m trying to focus on UL where possible so that I don’t need to worry about weight when we switch from camping to backpacking.

I recently got a copper spur UL3 long but am now looking at a sleeping system that satisfies the following:


Person 1:


1.Sleeps very warm and likes to be chilly

2. 6ft 4, 230 lbs and sleeps in a fetal position (so looking for something 30 inch wide if possible)

3. Hates any restrictive feeling so can’t be in a sleeping bag or enclosed


Person 2:

1. Gets cold very easy, loves to be toasty and constricted (cocooned)

2. 5ft 7, 130 lbs and finds sleeping a relatively easy task in any position (no resentment here..none)





This is definitely where weight can be sacrificed if the gains in sleep quality are beyond marginal.

 There’s so many options and considering our different needs, I’m seeking advice due to feeling overwhelmed.

48,1696455257.0,Pack for a climber with the waist measurement of a moderately sized stick bug,"Hello /r/ultralight ! After an REI backpack experience that involved one fitter radioing for the most experienced backpacker in the store, and said backpacker employee invoking the name of his own god in hopes it may find me a pack that fits... I come to you all for help...

The primary issue is hip belt adjustment. I prefer to wear the hip belt on the high side to avoid the feeling of a deep tissue massage on tensor fasciae if I low ride or glute medius if I use recommended belt placement. I measure approximately **25**"" where the belt rides. Of what I had access to, Osprey Womens Mira 32 was the stop-gap solution, as it was the only option which had a minimum adjustment less than 26"". Torso height set for probably 16-17"" equivalent. At 3.5lbs the bag is both heavier and smaller than I had in mind. As I have come to find, most brands seem to place the minimum between 26"" and 28"" while I would like probably 24"" as a true minimum adjustment. Kids packs tried thus far were of vastly inferior quality and too narrow in the shoulders.

**Needs**: 1-2 day trip out to the crag with gear, 2x pairs of shoes, 18 draws, anchor building equipment, water + snacks for < 5 miles approaches. Partner carries rope generally but it'd be nice to be able to carry one too.

* **Framed, probably 40-55L** \- the 32L pack I used caused me to compromise on snacks and shoes, and lacked ability to carry a 70m rope be that inside (larger size) or outside across the top (Smaller size.) Climbing gear weight comes out to about 12lbs currently, while a 70m would add upwards of 11lbs. I carry typically about 6lbs of liquids and however much snacks end up being.
* **Minimum hip belt adjustment 25"" or preferably less (23""/24"")** \- Think of the poor REI employee ): Steve tried so hard but I was just too skinny \[read in Mulan match maker voice\]. I should mention here chest measurement is 36"" because lats and swimmer shoulders, so narrow shoulder strap placement may pose an issue as it did with children's gear. I am shaped like a Dorito that shrunk in the wash. Torso about 16-17""
* **Nalgene sized side pocket -** I like to carry out a smoothie in and insulated bottle about the size of a Nalgene because it's just the easiest tummy friendly nutrition to start the day with. Side pocket on the mira is a royal pain to put a nalgene in with the pack packed.

**Wants**:

* **Water reservoir support -** I am stupid and will drink 25% less water without a tube dangling in my face. It would be nice if I could put my water reservoir somewhere comfortable and have the hose be held somehow. Not an absolute must though, as the opposite side pocket the Nalgene could probably fit a 1.5L res or something.
* **Zipper Access -** is nice as what gear is used varies route by route, and rolling/unrolling bag seems suboptimal?
* **Back gap** \- I enjoyed feeling breeze on my back with the osprey. Im sure there's many ways to achieve this, doesn't have to be a full trampoline.
* **Tolerance to imperfect packing** \- upon arrival to the crag not all the gear is going to be in the bag all the time and it will vary route to route. Imperfect packing resulting in my back being poked with a carabiner would be a minor bummer. Back gap want may inherently solve this bullet point
* **No/minimal obvious hotspots** where the pack sits on my back. It'll bug me if it pokes me.
* Fun colors - Okay okay this is a stretch goal, but everything climbing is moving to black and white these days, can you blame me?

Budget: Irrelevant. If it makes my approach easier I will do it. I'm outside to enjoy the climb, not hate the walk up to it. Cheap is cool, but when I'm buying gear it always feels like unicorn hunting so at a certain point I just want to hear the options. Seriously if you think it might maybe possibly work, or work with a caveat or anything... just toss it below.

Am I missing important details? Solutions that are not just a bag that I have not even considered? etc? Please let me know! Y'all are the experts to be sure.

**Useful Pre-Trip Information or Overview**: The shuttle service stops running when entry permits stop issuing, on the last day of September. If you are exiting in October, you need to arrange your own transportation. I parked at the southern terminus and shuttled to the north. I ended up giving rides to Victoria to 4 other hikers in my little Honda Fit who missed their 9/30 shuttle. There was a lot of weekenders at the Gordon River campground so it could be a possible hitch.

I did this trip almost as fast as I feel it is possible for most people to turn around from Seattle: leaving directly from work 5:30PM  Wednesday up I-5, catching the 9:00PM Tsawwassen-Swartz ferry, and sleeping politely in my car in the Gordon trailhead that I arrived at 1:00 AM. I took the 9:15AM shuttle van to Pachena Bay and was on-trail SOBO by 2:30pm Thursday. I would have made the 3:00PM Swartz-Tsawwassen on my exit had we not been delayed at Jordan River for an hour or two due to a terrible traffic accident just ahead. As it was I was showered and in bed in Seattle by 10pm Sunday. The orientation rules and Gordon ferry schedule make it difficult to get a normal full day of hiking in to start or end the trail which is a little annoying, but with the travel logistics I felt I had hardly any slack time despite that. I was on-trail for about 70 hours, putting up the ferry buoy at 11:00 AM Sunday.

There were reservable car spots on the full ferries that became available from late cancellations for every Sunday sailing an hour or two before each one. I made my first reservation while sitting waiting for the Gordon River ferry, and changed it twice waiting for the Jordan accident to clear. I could probably just have done standby and it wouldn't have been terrible this late in the season, but it was a sunny Sunday afternoon so I was nervous.

ABSOLUTELY **DO THIS TRAIL IN SEPTEMBER**. Permits were freely available all summer for this time of year. A half dozen or so other folks started when I did, far from the 25 limit. I was not alone but it was not crowded. I never waited for a ladder. It was 60F day 40F night, super comfortable. And the folks who were out there for any longer than I was had great stories contending with the storm that went through before  I arrived. That storm meant the fire ban was lifted and I enjoyed backcountry campfires for the first time ever. Just a superb experience and a welcome difference from the weak foliage of spring or the heat of summer hiking.

**Photo Album**: [https://imgur.com/a/LbDBIrP](https://imgur.com/a/LbDBIrP)

**The Report:** This is a popular trail with many of the highlights already well publicized and you get the ranger orientation too. So mostly I'll gloss over the scenery.

My trip coincided with a \~10ft tide range with a high 12ft tide in the early afternoon and a low 2ft tide around sunset every day.

I did this trail in 3 nights. I felt like I didn't really have time to stop and explore the views as much as I would have liked to. The rangers are correct that you really have to be literally watching your footing the whole time and if you want to look up you have to stop, which is part of why it's so slow going. There really is so much interesting novelty to explore along this trail especially along the beach that even as someone who likes to hustle dawn to dusk, i would have enjoyed a trail zero to just do some focused tidepooling. I usually like to take a sit-down cold soak lunch with my spoon and everything and I did not have time. I just constantly ate bars and bite size snacks while mostly moving and this did keep my energy up.

**Day 1:** Pachena Bay to Tsocowis

The ranger orientation is where I learned Walbarn is considered the ""halfway"" point based on time to complete rather than distance. I hadn't seen this information anywhere else in my planning.

High tide meant forest route to start. Forest to Michigan and beach to Tsocowis. I did have time for a few minutes with the sea lions and the lighthouse keepers who cautioned my original itinerary of Tsocowis, Cribs, Camper, Exit. At this time of year, the bugs are down and the mushrooms are up. I saw so many incredible fungi. Picturesque examples of all the famous dramatic ones from Amanita to Wooly chantrelle. Behemoth boletes the whole way. I LOVE LATE SEASON!

Michigan and Darling were utter non-issue walk-across fords. I don't remember if my feet stayed dry, they wouldn't for long so I didn't care. Just past Michigan, I met a bear and cub foraging on the beach. As soon as I noticed them I began saying ""hey bears"" every minute or so. Since they were at the high water line and tide was lower by now, I went down on to the rocks and passed them at a steady pace continuing to talk to them. They looked at me once and otherwise ignored me.

You learn pretty quick how to judge the tidal rocks by sight for whether they're slippery or not. If they're suspiciously bare, they're slick. I was nervous about beach hiking because I thought it would be hard to spot where to re-enter the trail. It wasn't, entrances are well marked. I encountered 0 surge channels the whole way since I skipped the Owen beach. 

Tsocowis toilet has stairs not a ladder. Throne of kings. There just feels like something Wrong about climbing with your hands out of a shit palace. Other than the trail guardian in the cabin I was alone at this campsite.

**Day 2**: Tsocowis to Walbarn

It was nice to put on the neoprene socks in the morning. I did not need them in this temperature range, but they did make it easier to get going in the predawn. I swapped them at Klanawa for wool Injinji.

Every single one of the famous cable cars on this trail saves you one of the world's easiest fords. Do one of them for flavor and skip the rest unless you need the arms/upper back workout. I did the first, Klanawa, which might be the longest, and as a solo my momentum carried me all of 10 whole ft away from the platform before I had to start hauling. To avoid a ford of oh, shin depth. I'd just changed my socks and this clouded my judgement.

The Nitnat ferry operator is very kind and comes over as soon as spots you. No waiting. If you have never seen a river reverse with the tides, watch for it at the Narrows. Sea lions and salmon came up with it and were jumping about, and the tidal water is really dramatically moving! It's very cool to see.

Chez Monique's has been passed down to her descendant and is now called Nytom. I wasn't sure what I was looking at what appeared to be a residence so I didn't stop but I heard from others that you could. If you plan to purchase food in-route, pack less with you! 

My original plan of Cribs was out, plan B was Bonilla, but I rolled into Bonilla at 6:20 PM. 40 minutes of daylight and a straight beach shot with lowering tide? I pressed on for Walbran.

The beach between Bonilla and Walbran has the most annoying loose sand. However, I think it was in here where I pulled a fossil shell out of a sandstone wall, which was really cool. (I put it back)

Right after crossing Walbran river was the only time I fell on tidal stone. I got excited trying to hurry into camp over slick stone and ate shit.

**Day 3**: Walbarn to Thrasher Cove

My third bear was in one of the bogs south of Walbarn. I'd been making regular noises for an hour or two and got tired of it, even though I noticed the wet impressions of bear prints on the boardwalk--not a footprint type that lasts very long. It ran off ahead of me and I stood there and spoke at it until I hadn't heard it anymore for a few minutes and resumed intermittent noisemaking until I ran into a NOBO group who I assumed had already de-bearred the rest of the trail.

The difficulty of Camper-Thrasher is *not* overstated. I didn't keep exact time but the officially recommended 5 hours is in fact a safe window with a reasonable, not overly conservative, amount of slack to cope with snacks, injuries, animals, etc. I would not want to do the final descent to Thrasher in the dark. Didn't have the tide window for Owen Pt so forest it was. Again, the main obstacle is slipperiness, so even if you are capable of moving quickly, it's a different thing to move quickly and safely on slimy surfaces with rusty nails and sometimes nasty drop-offs on the sides. *Trust No Log*. 

If it were *any* wetter, it would have absolutely been 5+ hours just trying to stay upright. Parts of this area reminded me of Old Mailbox or descending east from the Core Enchantments. Unlike those however it's constant up and down instead of sustained up/down. I really, really enjoyed that about it! I felt much less fatigued and much less ''over it'' than I think I would otherwise when I was able to vary my movements more.

**Day 4:** Thrasher Cove to Gordon River

The difficulty of this stretch *was* overstated. It took 20-25 minutes, not 1hr, to ascend to the trail from Thrasher. Overall it took 3hrs to exit from Thrasher, not the cautioned 5. This section was very familiar to me compared to other kinda rough wet PNW hikes, with some rocks and roots for flavor, and of course some ladders, but not nearly as slick or complicated as Camper-Thrasher.

My legs are bruised up and down in several places. I fell maybe 5-8 times and stumbled many more, and I feel I was able to fall and slip more safely because of having a lighter pack than anyone else I met. Most of the falls were due to slick wood and slick roots. One fall was due to a hidden jutting branch on the narrow eroded ""cliff''side path into Cullite Camp that I walked badly into. Overall my legs feel pretty good though. The slipperiness forces you to walk with your glutes not your calves which I think helped prevent re-aggrivating a shin injury that I sometimes get.

**Gear Notes:**

Bring **real soap.** You're climbing with your hands on ladders in/out of most of the toilets, which seems like a norovirus superhighway to me if I've ever seen one. you want to fondle every other camper's toilet shoe??? 

**Single wall shelter** was a risky move here, however this is my first year with it so I might just still be on the learning curve. Even in clear weather, the sea air humidity and temperature change meant insane condensation. It would have been nice and possibly faster camp cleanup to be able to store the dry inner separately and deal with a wet fly alone. I must have wrung out 6 or 7 ounces of water from my little rag that I wiped out of the inside of my tent on the morning at Walbarn. If it had rained outside, the percussion would have meant pretty terrible rain inside as well. Once, I tried sleeping with my poncho over my MYOG quilt. Bad move. That's not how VBLs work, and the underside of the poncho was of course the wet one. 

However, the **water resistant down from Loose Goose** didn't seem to mind, or the **M10 Nylon** was water resistant enough to protect it. I was able to sponge off most moisture. I had been concerned about not bringing a puffy OR a wind/rain jacket, but I absolutely had sufficient insulation for this trip, with the weather window I had.

**Neoprene socks** were not necessary in this weather window, but sure would be nice if it were any colder.

**Platypus water bag** worked well as a hot water bottle. No leaks. Just 250-300ml or so got my quilt a pleasant head start on warmth. I didn't bother drinking any of the water used to heat it, though. I didn't really need this either but it was a delightful luxury 1oz. It did not replace the Smartwater because the threads don't fit my bidet/faucet and Smartwater does. Its also not as nice to drink from.

The provided **paper map** is really useful and I almost never used my phone for navigation. I did use my phone for the **""Tide Charts"" app** which was really useful. As such, I used way less phone battery than usual and **never once touched my power bank.**  Despite having phone service (first T-Mobile, then Rogers) every night and texting away. I also listened to the ocean at night and did **not use headphones** (I usually sleep to audiobooks)

The **showa gloves** were nice to have on some especially slimy ladders because of the extra grip. In wetter weather they would be safety gear in my opinion.

Hard to tell difference between wool and synthetic **Injinji.** I think I like the wool here. I think they were more comfortable wet. But I wish they came in a shorter length because they'd be easier to dry out by putting them against my body in bed at night. With more material, that works much less effectively. And I expect that they'll be more fragile long term than the synthetic?

Half of a *""***Swedish Dishcloth""** beat the pants off a scrap of **Pactowl** in terms of managing condensation.  SO much more absorbent. I'm done carrying Pactowls I think except maybe on a thru as a face cloth.

**Topo Terraventure 3** tread lugs got pretty ground down by the sandstone and barnacles, and the stock insole doesn't do well with abrasion while wet. The eventual pilling on the insole is one of my few blister triggers, but between the neoprene and the wool I somehow avoided them. I'm honestly shocked, I usually have really sensitive feet. Only way to improve the outsole for this trail though is to embed studs in it for the wet wood. I was fantasizing about studded or grip-paper shoes on the way to Thrasher. ",Ultralight

57,1696291188.0,UL pack for short person and thoughts on KS40 options?,"Hello, my base weight is 12 lbs with a 3lb 13oz backpack, so I think I'm about ready to purchase an UL backpack. I'm pretty much set on getting the KS40 but wanted to ask people's opinion on the options.  


First of all I'm very short at 4'11"". My torso measures to 38cm according to Laurent's site. He then adds 3cm so my size would be 41cm. I've emailed Laurent a few times asking if he thinks the 44cm would still fit me. He said it might be a tiny bit tall but should still work. Do you think this is fine or should I consider a different brand/pack? It's hard to find UL packs for short people. I know HMG makes one but I'm not that interested in their pack for that price. ULA also makes a ""kid"" backpack that would probably also work but I want to go lighter.

KS40 options:

Fabric: How's Spectra 200D white? Mainly want this for aesthetic reasons (I like white) and I don't mind that its not waterproof but would like it to hold up to gentle use. For the bottom, straps, side pockets, and front pocket I'm considering either 330D Cordura or the black Spectra 200D. The spectra is lighter but I'm thinking the higher wear areas might benefit from the durability of Cordura? 

  
Cinch vs Roll top: I think I'll like cinch more for faster access and less fuss. Not 100% sure though.  


Bottom pocket: Really debating on this. I might really like it or I might not ever use it. I suppose I can always get it and cut it off if I don't end up using it?  


13mm V strap: It's not that much more weight and I think I would prefer this over the single strap. I don't plan to carry a bear canister, but I'd like the option just in case. Is the 13mm V strap fine or should I consider the 20mm Y strap instead?  


I will probably get the removable stays, lineloc load lifters, hip belt pockets, upper side pockets, and ice axe loops. Everything else default.",Ultralight

59,1696231129.0,Shakedown request for winter in the Sierras 6k-10k elevation,"Hey guys! Now that fall is nearly here just prepping my shoulder and winter kit and was hoping to get some feedback. The requisite shakedown info: 

**Location/temp range/specific trip description**: Sierras, low single digits to 30F. I live very close to the range, so any last-minute changes in the forecast that push weather outside of this range will just mean the trip gets pushed back a week.   

**Goal Baseweight (BPW)**: Whatever number will make /u/DeputySean proud of me

**Budget**: Let's pretend it's infinite for now

**Non-negotiable Items**: No sacred cows but the 1.8L pot with heat exchanger will be shared with at least one other person so would only be interested in exchanging for something lighter but as capable/efficient at snowmelting. Also open to a lighter shelter but picked the [Moment DW](https://www.tarptent.com/product/moment-dw-li/#tab-id-2) because it is modular, can be paired with different bivies, requires only two stakes and with the carbon fiber crossing pole is capable of handling serious wind and snowloading. Would want a candidate replacement to also have these qualities if possible. 

**Solo or with another person?**: At least one other person

**Additional Information**: Goal is 2-3 day trips for now.

**Lighterpack Link**: [here](https://lighterpack.com/r/5qwgck). 

What is currently set to quantity 1 is a bit arbitrary so exact weight will vary quite a bit from trip to trip depending on conditions. Goal is to have a flexible and modular kit that can handle anything from shoulder season with cold temps and limited weather to winter temps down to about 10F, high snow and moderate weather. 

It *feels* like I've got everything needed to make that happen but let me know if you see anything that feels underbuilt/too lean. The only thing that I don't have at the moment is some crampons, but that's mostly because I'm just not going to be on anything technical enough for long enough to justify bringing them at the moment. And it'd also require buying some real winter boots which is a bit more than I want to spend at the moment given that terrain like that in deep winter would imply more avalanche risk than I'm comfortable with until I have some more experience. 

Have seen plenty of nights into the teens and some into the high single digits, but I have an advanced neuropathy in my legs and arms which means I tend to feel more pain from cold so my loadouts will definitely need to be more conservative than a normal person's for the same temps. I know I should swap out the Versalite for a true 3L Goretex piece so would love some suggestions -- I tried Montbell's Storm Cruiser but the medium compresses my down layers and the large feels like a sail so am going to need something else I think. 

Yellow star means it's on the way, red means I don't have it yet.

Non-negotiable Items: Tyvek; Wind Shirt; Not going cold soak or no-cook, that shit is miserable.

Solo or with another person?: As solo as you can be starting on the AT in mid-April

Additional Information:

Most of this served me well on the PCT last year, so I'm just looking for suggestions as I've never hiked on the East Coast before. Plenty of experience hiking in the rain as I currently hike and camp 3 seasons in Washington.

Pack is new to me. I've only used a frameless pack for 2-3 day trips before. Also looking at the Kakwa 40L for a framed pack, but I got this GG G4-20 for cheap on ulgeartrade, so hoping it works out. I used the GG Gorilla on the PCT and it was excellent, hoping I can go for a smaller volume as 6-7 day food carries aren't a concern on the AT for the most part. I'll be taking it out for a weekend hike sometime soon hopefully.

I'm also weighing bringing my hammock setup instead of the tent. I used a tarp on the PCT and cowboy camped about 60% of the time, but the rain on the AT and ticks (I use permethrine on all my clothes) make me a little nervous about that. Hammocking is way more comfortable and I like the process of figuring out the hang, but it's also heavier and bulkier.

I run warm both while moving and while sleeping, so I think the 30 degree quilt will suffice. I've taken it below freezing while adding my wind layers, though I definitely noticed it was cold. I have a 20 degree quilt I can also bring, but I'm hoping the cold nights will go away as the hike goes on and I don't have to switch out. Open to suggestions from others who know the area and nights better than I do.

**The Report:** My buddy and I set out from Amicalola with a goal for a 100 day AT hike to wrap up our triple crown. Both of us are west coast hikers, and had a pretty hard time getting into the trail itself. Physically, it is far more difficult than the PCT and CDT. Mentally, it was on par with the others, the challenge being not going crazy seeing the same scenery for the first half.

Once getting into New England, I found myself more engaged with the scenery much more. I really liked CT and MA. 

 I was bed-ridden with a bacterial infection for 10 days in New Hampshire, which made finishing off the rest of the trail a bit difficult, losing all my momentum. The rain in Vermont was pretty bad, but I didn't get the worst of it.

Every day was exhausting. No zeros, other than getting sick, and hopping off trail for a fam reunion in CO. 25 mile days on the AT felt like 30-35 mile days on the PCT. This trail wants to beat you up, take your lunch money, and call your momma fat.

That being said, I enjoyed the pure, raw, physical challenge this unrelenting terrain provided. I will never want to do this trail again, but I'm glad I did it. We went too fast to build meaningful trail family relationships, so I recognize I missed a key part of the the AT experience.

66,1696133537.0,Sleep system to reduce night sweat,"I am planning for a few weeks of the TA in December/January and just finished my shakedown hike (Cooloola Great Walk; 88km in South East Queensland, Australia). A huge problem that I had not predicted was how much I sweat at night. I was using a lightweight summer sleeping bag (down) and a klymit pad and sleeping in a combination of capilene shirt, nitro-fleece midlayer and RAB conduit tights. I'm a hot sleeper at home and usually mitigate this by sleeping on and in only natural fibres and sleeping under a fan. 

I swest A LOT all four nights on the trail, despite temps being as low as 12 degrees C and keeping both sides of my x-mid open all night. Some nights I was borderline uncomfortably cold, and still sweated through my clothes. This had a massive impact on my enjoyment and comfort level during the hike because:
A) Being cold and clammy all night massively reduced the quality of my sleep
B) I never had any dry clothes, because both my hiking and sleep layers were constantly damp with sweat
C) I was rarely dry myself, and ended up with various rashes/chafing as you might expect.

I've been thinking a lot about how to reduce the night sweating without increasing my weight too much. Swapping the synthetic sleep layers for merino is the obvious choice, but as a fat/mid-size woman who doesn't tolerate wool very well, my options are limited. Would appreciate recs for merino base layers that come in a size 16+, especially from people who sometimes have trouble with wool and itching/headaches/nausea. 

I'm also thinking that a natural fibre liner would be helpful, to put a breathable, wicking layer between me and the sleep pad/quilt. The quilt I'll be taking on the TA is down, which I'm planning to use with the foot-bag snapped closed and quilt straps. I've checked out the STS silk liner and silk/cotton liner online, and have also seen some recommendations for the Cocoon shield. The cotton blend is attractive because of the feel, but obviously has some big weight/moisture drawbacks. Has anyone tried these sorts of products to reduce night sweats with success? I figure that at least I would be putting an airable/washable layer between me and my quilt. 

Advice please! 
Would love to hear about people's experience with liners, especially STS.

67,1696125424.0,Appalachian Gear 80/20 Long Sleeve Review,"Overview: This is a long sleeve alpaca shirt from Appalachian Gear. It is a base layer that can also work as a primary layer in many conditions. The bottom-line-up-front (BLUF) is that this garment is superior to similar wool garments in terms of warmth-to-weight and durability. I have used many baselayers over the years, both wool and synthetic. This is the best I have used, and it is sufficiently better that I felt the need to review it as soon as it crossed 200 miles (which was this past week).

Location: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Upper Peninsula (Michigan).

Lighterpack:  I know it’s blasphemy, but I don’t use a lighterpack (I just weigh my pack before/after adding consumables). But, I have paired it with an all-paca hoodie and my frogg toggs jacket. I typically don’t need to add a layer over it unless doing a static activity in temperatures below 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Mostly I’ve used this shirt as a standalone layer, but I’m excited to use it as a base layer this winter.

Images:  I rarely take photos of myself (or my stuff), but the manufacture’s photos are a good depiction of its appearance:  [https://appalachiangearcompany.com/products/mens-8020-long-sleeve-tee™](https://appalachiangearcompany.com/products/mens-8020-long-sleeve-tee™)

Specifications:

\-9 oz in a size XL (I am 5’ 9” 230 lbs and this shirt fits me close but not tight)

\-80% alpaca and 20% tencel.

\-NOT superwashed (unlike wool baselayers)

\-$102 plus shippingPros:  Whoa boy… lots of pros.

VERY durable knit compared to typical merino or synthetic base layers. I’ve snagged this piece on so many branches while going off trail to pee (which for me is basically every hour while hiking), yet there are no holes or runs that I can find. We have very dense woods up here, and I can’t stress how much of an accomplishment this is for a knit garment that is relatively thin.

The knit has a three-dimensional nature that adds more warmth than a merino base layer of similar weight, but remains just as cool/breathable.

Long shirt tail that stays tucked-in (tucking-in adds a ton of useful warmth when static).

Versatile. On my most recent trip, I didn’t bring any other top layers besides a frogg toggs jacket. The 80/20 was on my body for four days/three nights straight. Hiked and slept in temps ranging from high 40s to mid 70s. Never had to add my frogg toggs for extra warmth.

Doesn’t feel wet/clammy like synthetics, and dries quicker than wool.

Fabric doesn’t stretch out like superwashed wool baselayers do.

Cons:  Not comfortable (for me) in temperatures above 80 degrees. Cost is higher than typical wool or synthetic base layers. Heavier than synthetic base layers.

Limitations: Long term durability is definitely better than typical wool base layers, but I haven’t owned it long enough to determine how long it will go until it fails. Also, I haven’t used it in conditions above the mid 80s (but it probably wouldn’t go well).

Obviously have to make sure you have enough water/food/etc and think about resupply times.

Temperature probably also makes a big difference here. In colder temps there's more risk of hypothermia. But in warmer temps you're either getting soaked or totally sweating out your rain gear.

I  always have a small Sun MiniComp in my pack but I’m camping off trail a lot more often now and decided I really should bring a “real” compass and map. I was debating between the usual Suunto MC-2 and M-3 when I came across these thumb compasses they use for orienteering races. You can still lay it flat on a map, turn the bezel, and orient yourself. It seems you’d be able to triangulate, set a bearing to follow, everything you can do with a regular compass, but you just don’t have a numerical bearing. It would be way more handy than constantly having to pull out my phone for Gaia or a compass for a bearing. I wear running shorts and usually run so no extra pants pockets and I’d rather not have a compass banging around from my neck. And bonus it would be worn weight. 😂 

Is there something I’m missing or would I really not be missing out on much by not having a numerical bearing?

OG:

I’ve been using a HMG Junction 3400, and although I love the pack, the comfort level leaves something to be desired and has irked me enough that I have decided to sell it and replace with something more comfortable and a touch smaller, if possible, since my gear is more dialed in. After looking at a lot of options, if settled on either the LiteAF Ultra Curve 46 or SWD UL Long Haul (40 or 50, haven’t decided yet).

76,1695959167.0,Sleeping Bag Opinion,"Background on me: I live in New Zealand, and as such my options for lightweight sleeping bags are very limited, both in availability and price. The below are the only options I can realistically access from my country. 

I am looking at replacing my sleeping bag with a lighter, warmer option. The bag I have currently is a Rab Alpine Pro 400, weighs 980g and a limit rating of -6°C (just your standard backpacking sleeping bag). I have experimented with quilts but I have decided a sleeping bag is the only way to go for me. I have 2 options I cannot decide between:

The REI Magma 15F Regular, for NZD$337 (50% off) on clearance, with a weight of 800g, a limit rating of -9°C, and fabric thickness of 15D.

The Sea to Summit Spark III, available to me for NZD$550 (39%off), with a weight of 660g, a limit of -9°C, and fabric thickness of 10D. 

The thing I am struggling with, is whether the 140g weight drop in the Spark III is worth the small drop in durability of the fabrics, and crucially, whether it is worth the extra NZD$200, which is not a small amount of money to me. 

Has anyone used either or both of these options? Am currently very stuck and advice would be appreciated!",Ultralight

78,1695938410.0,Reducing consumables weight,"I have laid out my medical kit, my hygiene kit, and my foot care kit and carefully weighed each set of items. My goal is to reduce weight but also want to make sure I'm not forgetting anything. I'm so used to buying pre-made kids for the house or those yellow adventure bags I've never made these kits myself.

What i have purchaed and identified as weight reductions on my own: lighter scissors, a smaller toothbrush, and toothpaste tabs but that isn't going to take a huge dent out. Like 50g at most.

The Total of these 3 kits weighs 498g which is 17.5oz which I feel is overkill compared to alot of you.

The heaviest items here are the Ace wrap, runner glide, liquid bandage, and the gold bond tiny bottle. These are also my 4 most used items so not sure what to cut here. Maybe skip the bandaids and keep the liquid bandage? Or no bandaid or liquid bandage and just bring more leukotape?

Medical kit - In a perfect world, hopefully, I won't need to open this ziplock bag on the trail, but here are its contents:

139g total - Ace wrap, 2 large bandaid, 3 small bandaid, 2 antibiotic packs, 3 burn cream, water purification tablets, 2 immodium, 1 set gloves, 1 skin tact, 3 afterbite, safety pin, razer blade, tweezers, vitamin c, quick clot, 3 benadryl, 4 Sudafed, container ibuprofen, container asprin


Foot care kit - I plan on using this more often than the items in my medical kit so I broke this off separately.

222g total - Goldbond tiny bottle, runner glide medium tube, leukotape couple strips in a sticker backing, liquid bandage, tiny scissors


Hygiene kit - some basics for 3+ day trips so i can still feel human.

137g total - Dude wipes, toothbrush and paste, deodorant. Waiting on litesmith toothbrush and toothpaste tabs


EDIT
 swapped the scissors and tweezers for a tiny Swiss army knife that has that and a blade, and it saved me 8g. Swapped the liquid bandage and the Ace wrap for a whole roll of leukotape, because why not? It's the same weight, and as I hike more, I'll reduce what is on that roll to a more reasonable weight.

For everyone saying my foot care is overkill I definitely agree. I saw a podatrist and had him do the procedure so my ingrown toenails shouldn't regrow so hopefully in a couple weeks once these heal I will have a much easier time keeping my feet happy. Most of my problem is my big toes hoping this is a longer term fix.

Per someone's suggestion I have about 110g worth of drink mixes for electrolytes, I am trying out some more weight effective tabs I can swallow vs flavored powders. I should be able to throw those in a pill container. Probably going to save 80g swapping to that easily.",Ultralight
79,1695931949.0,Pitching trekking pole tent (HMG Mid 1) on sloping ground,"I recently got an HMG Mid 1 tent. It works great on flat ground and has been really easy to pitch.

Last time however I was on a non optimal sloping site and I couldn't set it up properly. The location was super rocky so I could not use stakes or move the tent around too much. I struggled with pitching the tent for quite some time by tying guylines on rocks. With the sloping ground, the best I could do had one side of the tent sagging badly and the tent was not at all stable in the wind.

In hindsight I guess I should've adjusted the length of the guylines more. Is my understanding correct that the guylines on the uphill side need to be as short as possible and the downhill guylines longer to compensate for the slope?

Also this just occurred to me - is it the case that the trekking pole needs to a 90° vertical wrt the ground for the pitch to work? If so it appears I would need to either have a longer trekking pole or use a pole extension to account for the fact that one side of the tent is effectively longer now (right?)

80,1695928429.0,Centennial Trail South Dakota - Sept 2023 Trip Report,"People ask about this trail so here's a sort of belated trip report.   
  
**Where**: Centennial Trail, 125 miles through the Black Hills of South Dakota  
  
When: Sept 1st through Sept 11th  
(I took 3 nearos, because its vacation! Also I almost had a heat stroke at one point so I had to call it at like 4 miles.)  
  
**My Gear**: https://lighterpack.com/r/m5yeks  
  
Just me solo. I was absolutely flummoxed by the climate/weather situation (see below.)  I didn't need camp shoes in September...but you may in spring. There are ropes at certain crossings which can be chest deep in the spring. I needed my puffy though some people said to leave that because it was triple digits farenheit coming off the plane. I wish I took rain bottoms even just for the one day I needed them because I couldn't really stop without shivering. I could have used a beanie and glove liners some nights but socks and my buff worked fine too.   
  
A five day food carry isn't too heavy but its just heavy/bulky enough that I needed the Circuit instead of the Kumo - which is more my weekend pack. I used my Fly Creek instead of my Notch due to the number of NFS campground options. Turns out you would be fine staking everything out without having to find rocks for pitching on tent pads etc. In the spring you may need your trekking poles there are some sketchy water crossings. But in the fall trekking poles weren't critical. That Fly Creek is actually lighter than most ""ultralight"" fully enclosed shelters once you ditch the trekking poles lol. I used that tend for years, I forgot how much I missed it.

 I didn't consider tarping because of the weather uncertainty, particularly having never been to this area before. But a tarp set up will absolutely work for this trail. But be cognizant of your head lamps and phone because some places are SWARMING with bugs like gnats and no see ums. They won't bite but they will annoy like crazy. Conversely there are some areas with NO bugs because they are windy  so maybe take a flat tarp to pitch low instead of an A frame like the MLD? A hammock will work for this trail as well. There's a couple places where it won't but not to the point of being a detriment.  
  
The last 2 days of the trip the water gets very...something (soft, hard, alkaline?) I dont know shit about hydrology.  I just know I couldn't make instant coffee and dehydrated protiens took effort to make edible with hot water. Just a heads up for the cold soakers. You may need more time to make your food?  
  
**Travel/Logistics Info**:  
I flew from LGA to RAP and got a Lyft to Town Place Motel in downtown Rapid City. I spent the next day in Rapid, grabbed some Isobutane from Roamin Around, a really great gear shop downtown, with an amazing shop dog (a standard poodle named Lucy) and walked down to the post office to mail resupply. I went to the Thursday night downtown free concert series, which was a hoot and a half!   
The downtown part of Rapid is SUPER walkable for someone flying in - so this trail makes a great vacation hike for that reason. Can get all your pre-hike ""chores"" done quickly and easily with no car/cab and have a fun night out.  
  
**Resupply strategy:**  
There are a lot of resupply strategies possible  on this trail which is nice. Most people send a box to Whispering Pines Campground about halfway and literally right on the trail but they close in mid September for the winter. Another option is to walk your box to Black Hills Outdoor in downtown Rapid and they will drive it out to Sheridan Lake Marina for you and hold it for free! (The marina is on the north side of the lake near the group campground. But thru hikers can camp in group campground.) Another option is to send it General Delivery to Nemo post office which has Weekday and Saturday morning hours and is about a mile off the trail. The food carry won't be long but depending on time of year and weather...you may want to stop and get hydrated. More on that in Weather/Water below.   
  
**Transport:**  
The internet makes it look like Prairie Hills Transit system will take you about an hour south to Hot Springs. The internet lies. My plan was to hop the bus and hitch to the actual trailhead in Wind Cave National Park. When that fell apart, the good folks at Roamin Around shop hooked me up with the shuttle driver Jon...absolute sweetheart (and may bring Lucy for the ride so you can pet lots of doggo before heading out.) The shuttle to be dropped off at the trailhead was $120 and well worth it. Jon has all the up to date trail intel. There is also parking there - but check with Wind Cave National Park about any overnight fees at Norbeck. I caught a ride back to downtown Rapid from Sturgis (which is about 6 miles north of the northern terminius at Bear Butte, where you can park overnight for free) with the same shuttle, the thru hiker right behind me from Virginia finished the morning after me and didn't even take my money.   
  
**Weather/Water:**   
Straight up the Black Hills has the wonkiest weather I have ever experienced on trail. It's not hard to read, but you don't get a ton of early warning of something coming in. And the daily temperature swings for me were about 60 degrees. Depending on your gear and how cold/hot you get, this is the biggest gear packing challenge. My second hiking day hit 104 degrees with 3-5 mile sections without shade. The night before it had dropped down to about 40  (this is fairly typical for early September, most of my nights were low 40s, but freezing is not rare in September at all.) Also there are afternoon hailstorms at about 3 PM-4PM in the Black Hills - almost daily some times of the year. They supposedly taper off in the fall but I saw three. I'm not saying bring a helmet but golf balls to baseballs are not rare so plan accordingly. Don't hide in the caves and rock overhangs though because that lightning can and will get very close to you.   
  
The water is best in the spring (May to June) which is the busiest season on this trail. When it's plentiful, your longest carry is about 7 to 10 miles. When it's not -  your longest carry is about 25-30 miles. By the grace of God, that long water carry section between Dalton Lake and Alkalai Creek is at least somewhat shady until the last mile so your risk of heat stroke should still be low. Usually many creeks are dry by September but it was a very rainy summer so I got lucky and had pretty good water. My longest carry was 9 miles I think. But at 104 degrees  even with nice sweeping prairie winds - it's like being in a convection oven. (I was told it's a ""dry heat"" so it should only feel like 102, which may be of some comfort to someone somewhere.) I downed 3 liters over that stretch and started to stress over my situation about a mile to the next potential source but I was fine. The CT's FB page has a constantly updated water report - or you can talk to Jon to get the beta. Know before you go for sure. I am from the east coast. I hike in New York we have more water than we know what to do with. I don't have much desert hiking experience. My 4L clean carry capacity (and 2L dirty capacity) may have been too much...but not by much. But I stress out about dry camping and water availability when I am in a place that doesn't have a clear, cold creek like every 500 yards. 

  
I also lathered on the sunscreen and still burned through my apparently crap sun hoodie I bought on Amazon for $12.  Honestly I'm usually one to skimp on the clothing system and buy the cheap stuff online because it's all gonna get filthy and break down anyway. I figure it's all the same junk sewn in Vietnam. This may be one of those trails where you should bring the good Arcteryx stuff if you have it because you will go from roast chicken to hypothermia in the span of 6 hours. I mean...I was fine with my REI garage sale rain shell because I only had one day of steady cold rain. But I probably would have googled a better sun strategy had I understood just how much UV assault I would suffer.   
  
**Terrain:**

 This is a nice cruise trail. There's no gigantic climbs, I think my biggest day was 3k feet. It's more constant ups and downs. It felt easy like Northern Oregon on the PCT, but I REALLY loved the landscapes. There's some really nice views...nothing gigantic like the Sierras or PNW or the Whites. But somehow just as cool though very different. The extreme north and south of the trail are a lot of prairies and canyons...extremely beautiful. The bulk of the middle is nice ponderosa pine forest punctuated by open balds and open rolling hills and bonkers cool rock formations. I had never seen undergroud creeks before. It's a really unique landscape and I thought it was stunning. And I am a big birder so it was like birding Christmas for me. Fall migration at the western most range of the eastern variants and the eastern most range of the western variants was absolutely fucking WILD. I had both and eastern and western Kingbird AND Meadowlark AT THE SAME TIME.   
  
The trail is punctuated by a series of reservoirs and lakes in 5 to 10 mile intervals. Those bodies of water often have walk in National Forest Service campsites with vault toilets, dumpsters and some have potable water pumps. There is a fee box but no camp host charged me. They were all incredibly kind. You may be thinking ""ugh I hate these!"" But crawling in that puppy at 4 PM when all the potential subdermal hematomas in the form of rock hard ice balls are falling from the sky...it is a relief (and lets be honest, pooping without digging is nice.) Some of that hail is big enough to shred your rain fly. Plan accordingly.   
  
The dispersed camping ON WATER is few and far between outside the NFS campgrounds. If you don't mind packing water or dry camping there are TONS of beautiful dispersed spots up on many of the balds and peaks you walk across.  But all the water convenient dispersed sites are meh. All the stunning ""omg I want to sleep here!"" sites are dry. (There's a couple sections where hammockers may have fewer choices but overall hammocks are fine for this trail.)  
  
BUT...campgrounds in South Dakota were like nothing I have ever seen before. Honestly. Every site seems like a full hookup RV site (so it's very easy to charge your stuff along the way...don't be tempted to take that 20k mah battery!) And the vast majority of recreational users of the Black Hills exist in a permanent caravan of Super Duty Pickup -> RV -> Trailer with at least and usually two full size UTVs and Side by Sides (or in some places there are horses in the trailer - I didn't see a TON of horse packers but heat and water availability may have been a factor.) You will be left with the feeling that you are the first and only person to ever venture in the Black Hills with less than a quarter of million dollars worth of internal combustion engines. I saw 1 other thru hiker, 1 weekend section hiker, 1 thru hiker was right behind me and 4 day hikers on the entire trail. And the 4 day hikers were all on the same day near Mt Rushmore . Most days, I walked all day without seeing a soul on trail outside of the NFS campgrounds.   
  
**Navigation:**  
Trail is MOSTLY well marked but I def did some bonus miles. There's a bunch of trail crossings in some places and you need be careful where you turn down. But there's no wayfinding, bushwacking or navigation you need to do. It's a pretty easy to follow trail...even in the spots where buffalo knocked the sign posts down (but use the Avenza maps and check your GPS now and again.)   
  
**Misc Awesome Things:**   
\-Huge scenic variety. Hills, prairie, grasslands, canyons, lake shore, peaks, aspen forests, pine forests, balds...there's a little bit of everything on this trail.  
  
\-Literally zero trash critters! This might change if the trail gets more popular or the YouTube hikers and Insta influences start pushing it. You see chipmunks and squirrels. But they don't want your food at all. You can ring your shelter in unwrapped cliff bars they appear to have zero interest as they only see a few thru hikers a year as of now and haven't figured out how delicious you are. Leave your food in your vestibule nothing is gonna touch it.   
  
\-The rest of the wildlife is really cool. You will see buffalo and pronghorns and mountain goats and prairie dogs and marmots and turkeys and white tail deer. As an east coast tourist I was THRILLED.   
  
\-There are no real road walks unless you go in and out of Nemo/Merritt (or Ft. Meade for whatever reason.) Even then the longest town/campground detour here is a mile, maybe a bit less. Some of the trail is on old forest road but it's not terrible. It's mostly nice single track the whole way. Some places have more horse muck than others but I didn't think it was a problem.  
  
\-Many sections have no cell service. Which was great. A lot of the times I didn't check, I'm sure there was at least some every day on the ridgelines and summits. But I sent my checkin texts nightly from my Garmin and that's all I needed to do. But there are plenty of places to check your phone and bail out if anything goes wonky at home. It's remote enough that it's enjoyable but no so remote you are doing 8 or 9 days out of pocket like on the AT Hundo or the Northville Placid Trail or something like that.  
  
\-The ending is spectacular. No its not like Hunt Trail up Katahdin spectacular but Bear Butte, Mato Paha is a very cool micro ecosystem all on its own and its just a very cool, easy hike start to finish. Then you get to pop into Sturgis, home of the Kentucky Derby of motorcycle rallies...which again, as a tourist was an experience. There's lodging, laundry, hot food, fun. Perfect post hike situation. Downtown Rapid again, was cool too. There's some great food (check out Ugly Graffitti, the chef is an AWESOME dude and the food may make you cry a little its that good.) I bought a Dead stealie sticker for my concert poster tube at Black Hills Vinyl. Alternative Fuel and Harriet and Oak had AMAZING coffee. It's a town that runs on tourism and the downtown will keep you entertained for a night or two for sure!   
  
\-The bar in Nemo! The Brandin Iron (no G.) Nemo is close enough to Sturgis that you are entering Biker culture. Bikers were cool and fun as hell to talk to. The town of Nemo consists of that bar, a gas station, a campground, a post office and a church all within a 2 block radius. It's basically a waystation for bikers on rides. (There's a couple of cabins and I think a bunkhouse at the campground, but I paid $20 and set up my tent and was all alone amongst the RVs and UTVs.) There was a guy named Marvin playing at the bar that night...a beautiful sunburst Martin and a banjo. He told me a story about buying that Martin after jamming out with Earl Scruggs' cousins and Hank Williams Jr's bassist. He was 74 and picking absolute fire all night long for HOURS. Bluegrass, folk, outlaw country. It was treat! Loved that bar.  
  
**Misc Not Cool Things:**  
\-There are ticks and poison ivy in the spring. Like a bunch. That is when the water is usually best. In the fall the Ivy is less irritating and the ticks are usually gone. I didn't bring any bug protection but a few places like Bear Butte Lake were absolutely swarming with non biting insects. If you can ignore them, it's all good. But check for ticks daily. I didn't get any because it was fall. But apparently spring can be tough tick wise.  
  
\-With the exception of some of the camp hosts (who are often thrilled to see hikers and will make you dinner and bring you firewood)...most people you meet in Nemo or at Legion Lake or at any of the trailheads, crossing roads etc will be absolutely baffled by the fact that you are walking 125 miles on purpose. Most locals have never heard of the Centennial Trail at all actually. The Black Hills have a long and somewhat shameful history as well as far as indigenous rights are concerned. Even now... seriously it's BAD and it's palpable. Even the camp hosts that were nice to a solo white lady often had no problem launching into a checklist of their issues with Lakota peoples to me apropos of nothing. I was like...whoa I am very uncomfortable with this. With few exceptions the spaces felt very segregated. Last year, like in 2022 - not 1963 - a hotel owner in Rapid publicly announced they would no longer rent rooms to indigenous people because they ""cant tell a good Indian from a bad Indian."" Like that was a thing that really happened. I'm from New York, we have well to do tribes and poor tribes both on and off the rez. But I have never in my life witnessed anything like this atmosphere before.  The area is surrounded by the 3 poorest reservations in the country. So if you are on foot, many people will think you are just extremely poor and possibly consider you dangerous. Most places are NOT hitch friendly. And road crossings where you have to pop out of and back into the woods can be unsettling. People yelled stuff from cars. I don't know what but t didn't sound nice and I didn't want to hang around and find out. It's not like the big trails where locals know hiker culture exists. I was offered a ride to Sturgis on a bike AFTER explaining the whole thru hike thing...like that the point is to walk. 

  
But it's also a good opportunity, if you are book/podcast listener to dive into the history and culture of the various Lakota tribes, who own the Black Hills but have no standing to run them like Havasupai and their famous hiking destinations. I forwarded all the fees that were waived for me and what I thought seemed like reasonable land use fees to the NDN Collective in Rapid, one of the organizations running the Land Back campaign. The Lakota Peoples Law Project is another. I dont know if that is sillly or patronizing or whatever, I recognize its like...nothing compared to the federal government's grazing permits and mining permits that seemed to be gifted to the large area landowners...but I honestly had no idea what else to do to be supportive. Its something that took generations to create and will take generations to unwind. We New Yorkers tend to feel money talks louder than anything else so that's what I went with mostly due to my own ignorance.   I didn't know about this part of the culture before I went, but it's important to note if you want to make an informed decision about hiking on the land.  
  
\-The 6 miles from Jim Creek to Nemo and the 7 miles from Nemo to Dalton Lake are on mixed use UTV trails. You will have to yield to MANY of these things for a small portion of the trail...which is too bad because it's an otherwise nice section. Some of them are basically 4 seater mini trucks. BRAAAAAAAAAP! In the overall mileage it's a small section, but wow are there a lot of UTVs out there. There's been a push to make a foot only reroute option I understand...but as of now there isn't one. If you can time that for like a Tuesday morning or something, it's worth the trouble.   
  
Anyway...that was my fall vacation to the Black Hills. As an NYC based hiker I am always looking for places I can fly to and make the logistics of resupply and transport do-able. I  can 100% confirm this trail is easily done without a car and 100% worth the trip. ",Ultralight
81,1695915628.0,Leak-proof ultralight containers for small quantities of thin liquid?,"Of all the different things I've tried for blister prevention, the best solution for me is applying compound tincture of benzoin to likely foot hotspots with moleskin on top just after it starts to dry. But that tincture is so hard to contain, and if it leaks, it reeks and gets everywhere. I have previously been putting it in small plastic sample vials I use to contain insect samples preserved in ethanol for long periods of time. Those work great for storing bugs in a box, but with all the shaking and air pressure changes from hiking at elevation, I've had my tincture of benzoin leak out a couple times now, including out of the zip-loc I used in case of leaks.

84,1695835831.0,Toothpaste: Something I've thought too much about,"There seems to be some disagreement about how to dispose of toothpaste in the backcountry. Specifically, there doesn't seem to be consensus on whether swallowing toothpaste consistently is safe. Googling leads you to articles about how the fluoride in the toothpaste is a toxin if consumed in large doses, so I wanted to see what the actual doses are compared to fluoridated tap water.

Colgate toothpaste contains fluoride at 1.5 mg/ml. If we assume 1 ml of toothpaste is consumed daily, 1.5mg of fluoride would be consumed. 

Tap water in the US is fluoridated to \~0.001 mg/ml. If we assume 2L (2000ml) of water is consumed daily, 2mg of fluoride would be consumed.

To be fair, I can see how consuming this fluoride in two larger doses could be more dangerous than in drinking water over the course of a day and there may be other ingredients in toothpaste to be mildly concerned about. Non-fluoridated toothpaste and no toothpaste are also decent options, but the fluoride in most toothpaste is there for a reason.

Could I make do with the Cloud Cover if I'm willing to wear clothes to sleep too?

As well as the massive difference in weight between the 2 options, the weight disparity is further increased because I would have to use a much larger heavier bag too

86,1695803379.0,Fuel canisters suddenly leaking for unknown reason?!,"After I screwed on my stove yesterday, the canister kept hissing gas when tightened fully.

**The Report:** Myself and a friend (both 29M)

**Day 1 (12.5 miles):** Drive in was 1+ hour on a dirt road. Had a sedan and bottomed out a few times so would recommend something with clearance. Register at trailhead (only car there), start around 0830 with 9L of water (for myself), walked 3 miles through a sparse pine forest which had a fire a few years ago. The trail was a bit hard to follow but GPS got us on course, was also pretty brushy so I was glad to have pants. There were reports of a water trickle near the rim, but we didn’t see any.  One very sketchy spot on the way to Marion point (loose gravel, path slopes towards canyon, massive drop-off at edge) - saw some day hikers who had turned around due to risk. Cached 2 liters each at Marion point. Continued towards tilted mesa going extremely slow - maybe 2 very sketchy spots. Took us a very long time! Finally descended towards tilted mesa - cached 2 liters each. The descent was very long, steep, and rocky! A few slips/trips/slides. A very hot Sun made us sweat a lot. Made it to the floor where there are lots of cacti on the trail. Finally made it to nankoweap which had plenty of clean and cool water. We rested, filtered, and I rinsed off. Originally we planned to get to Colorado river on day 2, but changed plans due to difficulty of the descent, so we threw on headlamps and followed the creek to the river. Very hard to follow the trail, mostly climbing over smooth rocks in old creek bed, and lots of criss crossing the creek. Saw some deer at one point. Arrived at Colorado river around 2200 and set up camp on a very sandy beach. Could see a rafting camp a few hundred feet down stream. I rinsed off in the Colorado, we ate, hung food in rat sack, and slept.

**Day 2 (6 miles, 4200’ gain):** Got sand everywhere while setting up the previous night. Woke up to beautiful views with the river nearby, overcast and drizzle. Ate breakfast on the beach and I went for a quick swim. We went to say hi to some rafters, who offered us a seat, coffee, water, and let us dump our trash (very friendly group of Canadians!) we originally thought the granaries were further downstream and decided to pass, but saw them above and opted to see them up close. Some of the best views of the trip! Saw a bighorn sheep. Started back up the nankoweap with a light load. Tried to follow the trail but made better time just walking in creekbed - on trail we were constantly stopping to determine which way the trail actually goes. Hit the end of the nankoweap and spent 45 mins filling up on water - partner was very concerned about running out of water so we filled up with about 10L each. Began our ascent which was brutal - on and off light rain, which turned into pouring for 10 mins. Got to our ending point above tilted mesa, we were soaked to the bone and cold. Existing wind break at the campsite was too small for partner’s BA tiger wall while setting up under pressure. We ended up taking it out and staking it in pouring rain. Weather cleared and we had a calm, cool night on the ridge. Surprisingly not very windy

**Day 3 (7 miles, 2700’ gain):** woke up at 0530 and got rolling around 0645. Weather was nice but started getting hot in the Sun fast! The places that seemed sketchy on the way in were of no issue. We had plenty of water and dumped a few liters. By the time we reached the rim we were beat. My partner was limping badly due to blisters. We made it to the car and had  long drive back to Phoenix.

**Gear Notes:**

**Good:**

Rail riders Sahara - I used to be on the Merino wool train, but I’ve been converted. This thing breathed well, blocked sun, and kept me cool. I loved the half zip!

OR Astroman pants - I got them based on deputy’s recommendation. Loved them! They are very light and comfortable. The stretchy material seemed to snag more than my partner’s pants, but I was surprised with how durable they were.

BD alpine carbon cork poles (flick lock) - Poles are a MUST for this trail to help navigate the sketchy areas. I’ve had the BD for a year now and I can’t emphasize how robust they feel. I trust them completely. Adjustability is great for the tent.

SWD Long Haul - Carried like a champ! Had plenty of space for all the water we carried. I never felt an awkward rubbing point even during our heaviest water carries.

Electrolyte powder - I haven’t used much before, but my partner had plenty to share. It gave me a big boost and I definitely noticed it make hiking easier. I’m going to be packing more powder on my trips.My partner had a poop trowel and I’ve been converted. Definitely going to pick one of these up.

NU-25 (updated version) - hiked for a few hours (2-3) in the dark. The red light on this illuminated the trail well and still had plenty of battery left to spare!

**Not-so-good:**

Danner 2650 Shoes - I really like these shoes. They fit me very well and I like the rigidity of the sole. However they lack a bit overall in durability. The sole started peeling from the cushion early on in my ownership, and there’s a flap of leather in the interior that frequently catches on my big toe nail. I’m looking to buy a new pair of shoes and not sure if I’ll do these ones again.

Durston xmid 2p - Honestly I haven’t perfected how to work with this tent. I struggle to fit the large footprint into spaces, which turns into a poor pitch with bad wind resistance. I know its user error but this has been my experience! I’m going to try improving my pitch so I can get more from the tent! Also, maybe single wall tents aren’t for me - the condensation is wild.

When attaching a filled dirty bag to a Sawyer Squeeze, the seal is not fully secure - this leads to water bubbling up around the edge of the filter and running down the bag, becoming a full stream if the bag is squeezed. This has made it more challenging to use as a gravity filter, as a setup that doesn't fully secure into a clean bag now risks contamination by dirty water flowing down the bag and dripping into the clean reservoir/bottle.

Hi all,  
For our longer section hikes and treks out west, I'm considering buying us one of these two tents. My concern is that the ZPacks Triplex Zip is very wide at 60,"" although many of the campsites we've used in California Sierras and Colorado provided more than enough room to accommodate this behemoth. For those of you that own it and use it regularly in the Sierras or along the CT, have you had trouble finding sites in which to set up? Secondary question is how does this tent do in weather?   


I'm tempted to buy the Durston Gear X-Mid Pro 2, but my concern with this tent is that the internal dimensions are too narrow. I use a 25"" pad and my wife uses 20"". So, that leaves only 3"" total width inside. Not a lot of room to store stuff, and we often do like to bring our backpacks inside because of marmots, etc. I also think that it will feel very tight, like we're sleeping on top of each other, and I really dislike that feeling. For those of you that own this tent and use it with a partner in the manner I've described, have you found it to be cramped. Do you have room to store packs and adequate space between you and your partner?   


So, as you can probably tell, I'm leaning towards the Zpacks Triplex Zip, but I wanted to check-in and get your impressions before laying out such money.

103,1695506005.0,Fleece loft loss after washing: A call for clo testing and in-the-field experiences,"Upon wearing, washing and testing a few different types of fleece, I have noticed a pattern of the fleece appearing to lose its loft, form clumps and generally appear to be less insulating due to these changes.

The following images illustrate this change in appearance;

**Fleece, before and after washing**

   * After: [https://imgur.com/a/aXOOgCJ](https://imgur.com/a/aXOOgCJ) (at least 50% loft deduction, fibres are now curled and flat)

* Polartec alpha direct:
   * Before: [https://imgur.com/a/SKp6I3n](https://imgur.com/a/SKp6I3n) 
   * After: <sadly I no longer have evidence of alpha direct, but it does lose some of its fluffiness and loft to a degree, albeit not as extreme as teijn octa.> 
* Polartec high loft:
   * Before: [https://imgur.com/a/DBwkXwZ](https://imgur.com/a/DBwkXwZ) (albeit with some compression causing the fibres to be flat)
   * After: [https://imgur.com/a/WV9nSXJ](https://imgur.com/Ql1hQHv) (you can see the subtle clumping effect on the upper edges)

**My questions to you**

* Does anyone have any / know of any measurements regarding the insulation value of fleece before and after this 'de-lofting' effect has taken place? 
* Or alternatively, has compression of your fleece(s) caused a similar deduction in loft and (presumably) a deduction in insulation?
* Have your noticed/experienced similar changes in your fleece's appearance after getting wet / washing? And if you have not, what humidity conditions / drying arrangement have you used?
* Do you think that a more durable fleece (e.g. regular micro fleece) would be less effected by this phenomenon (due to appearing relatively similar after washing) and therefore be a better choice than technical fleeces in the long run?
* What experiences have those using the karuishi fleece (e.g. kuiu peleton 97), or the north face's future fleece, or patagonia's R1 air fleece had in regards to this appearance change??

**Additional information:**

\--- How I washed / dried the garments ---

* These garments / samples were washed on a regular wash, before going through a regular cycle in the dryer.
* Most of the pictures have had between 1 and 3 of these washing / drying treatments.
* I have also tried washing at different temps / air drying, which have yielded similar results.

\---Context of my high humidity testing---

* In the uk, where I do most of my hiking, the average humidity for months with average daytime temperature of less than or equal to 14C (<= 57f) is 82% . Narrowing down to the rainier areas would increase that figure to at least 85%, to my assumption.
* This results in clothes that are unable to dry, even when left overnight, which makes this appearance issue significantly worse.

105,1695340863.0,Comfortable + Light + Durable Backpack 50L or more,"Hello!

I am looking to upgrade my backpack: I currently have a quite sturdy and somewhat comfortable backpack (It's an old Quechua 50L backpack).

The bag currently weighs around 1.8kg or so and I would like to find something around 1kg or less that has the following features:

- **Durable** (possibly BIFL): I don't go bushwacking but I plan to use the backpack also for travelling, so I want something that can that some weight and damage if needed. No holes just because I put it down on the wrong spot.
- **Comfortable**: On long hikes, I tend to get some upper shoulders pain (due to an old injury), so I absolutely need a good hip/waist belt to offload the weight. I can go for slightly heavier if that means I get to feel less pain on a 4+ days journeys (of course, this would also be helped by carrying a lighter pack)
- **Light**: I am thinking/hoping between 600g and 1kg, I don't want to go pure UL as I want something that is durable and comfortable but the lighter the better (for example, I wouldn't go frameless just to shave off some grams)
- **Pockets + Side mesh areas**: I like putting stuff on the sides or in pockets, so that's something I look for.
- **Volume**: I'd like something around 50L+ as I want to use it for my own traveling life. I recently tried a 30L and that was definitely way too small for 4 days for me.

Good to haves:

- **Rain-proof**: If the bag was already rain-proof (not monsoon level pour but still handle getting wet) or had some material to use to cover it whenever needed, that would be a plus.
- **Water reservoir support**: It would be nice that I could put by water reservoir somewhere comfortable and have the hose be held somehow. Not an absolute must though.
- **Decent Damage/Repair Warranty**: Since I'd like to BIFL, I would like some good worldwide warranty for a long while (maybe lifetime?). Not a must but it's always a good to have.
- **Repairability**: Similar to above, I'd like that the bag can be somehow fixed/patched up if something happened to it.

In terms of price, since I am hoping to find my ""final"" backpack, I am not really concerned as long as it is not much higher than $500-600. If it is worth it, I might go higher but not necessarily just because it has a specific brand.

For info (not sure if that matters but I saw people putting it): The base weight on latest hike was around 8.2kg (18lbs) and that was with a tent for 2 people and extra clothes for fall/winter weather (-2 degrees nights).",Ultralight

&#x200B;

Weekend warrior here looking to take the next step and prepare for my first thru-hike next summer (likely the Northville Placid Trail in NY). I am looking for suggestions for a tent and FRAMED UL or lightweight 50-60L backpack. Willing to spend up to $550 for both. Here is my current setup: [https://lighterpack.com/r/4dqhfd](https://lighterpack.com/r/4dqhfd). And here are my proposed upgrades: [https://lighterpack.com/r/ukq1or](https://lighterpack.com/r/ukq1or) (starred means I already own).I am mostly looking for a setup that will situate me well for 3 season trips in New England (the Adirondacks, White Mountains, etc…). 

&#x200B;

Packwise, I think I have it narrowed down to either the Durston Kakwa 55 or the Outdoor Vitals Shadowlight. I like the extra load capacity that these have.For the tent, I am thinking of the Tarptent Protrail, which is the lightest option within my budget that I’ve found, but I have listed a few other options I have been considering. 

&#x200B;

My priorities are space and weather-proof. Never having owned a single-wall tent, the idea of condensation does concern me, but I am open to learning how to use one. Also wondering if I I would be happier with a 2 person for the extra space.I welcome your suggestions, as well as just a general shakedown of my gear!",Ultralight
107,1695325376.0,"Travel Hiking the Peaks of the Balkans, Decathlon to the Rescue","My partner and I have been travelling Europe for the past 3 months and discovered we like hiking.

Our first tour was 2 nights in the Dolomites in June and I loved it. We don't have mountains where we're from in Perth, Australia. We got the trip done but I was too cold to leave the refuges when the sun went down because I only had shorts and a light jumper. I was disappointed because I wanted to watch the stars.

We decided to make the Peaks of the Balkans our second tour. I learnt a lot in our first tour and I knew 7 nights in September was going to require more preparation and gear, especially if I wanted to look at the stars.

At the same time, we don't have room for lots of hiking gear. We're primarily travelling and only hiking some of the time. I'm calling this Travel Hiking. We're onebagging with 40L Osprey Farpoint bags and space is limited even without hiking gear.

Budget is also important because I don't know exactly what I need (I'm from Perth) and I'm not sure how many hiking tours we're going to do.

Decathlon to the rescue. After researching this sub, probably excessively, I bought what I needed for the second tour.

**Here's what I learned**

1. The FH500 Helium Wind Jacket is the MVP. It's $35 euros and 120g and I wore it more than any other item. It kept me warm enough at night with 2 short-sleeve polyester shirts on, no jumper, down to sub 10°C. I saw stars! It kept me warm enough in 40kph winds on the ridge between Montenegro and Kosovo after the Tri-Country Summit and cool enough hiking in the valley below. Wing gear is the real deal. [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-fast-hiking-windbreaker-jacket-fh500-helium-wind/\_/R-p-307221](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-fast-hiking-windbreaker-jacket-fh500-helium-wind/_/R-p-307221)
2. NH500 Rain Pants and Running Tights are a versatile combo. $18 euros, 200g and $16 euros, <100g, respectively. I was warm on sub 10°C nights, so much so that I was able to go a bit lighter on my top half. I wear shorts during the day then tights after I shower. Then I add rain pants when it gets colder. On the windy day I wore them over my shorts and they warm enough on the ridge and cool enough in the valley. Then I took them off when it was warmer. [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-waterproof-hiking-over-trousers-nh500/\_/R-p-345947](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-waterproof-hiking-over-trousers-nh500/_/R-p-345947) and [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/run-dry-men-s-running-tights-black/\_/R-p-164591?mc=8381942&c=black](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/run-dry-men-s-running-tights-black/_/R-p-164591?mc=8381942&c=black)
3. My Running Shoes survived. I hiked the whole trail in Atreyu running shoes and they were comfortable, stable and grippy enough for me. I only ankle tested myself and slipped a few times. I run far more than I hike and hiking shoes wouldn't fit in my bag. [https://atreyu.com/collections/products/products/the-base-model-v2-0?variant=40371485474974](https://atreyu.com/collections/products/products/the-base-model-v2-0?variant=40371485474974)
4. My 26L Deuter daypack was just enough. I couldn't fit a jumper or jacket and thankfully didn't need it. Any colder and I would have.
5. Hike 900 synthetic and wool socks were comfortable. Not too sweaty and they dry quickly. I didn't get a chance to get them wet on the trail. [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/hiking-socks-hike-900-mid-2-pack/\_/R-p-330158?mc=8616554&c=grey](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/hiking-socks-hike-900-mid-2-pack/_/R-p-330158?mc=8616554&c=grey)

**Ideas for next time**

1. More compact pants. I imagine wind pants are more compact than rain pants and rain proof isn't important to me on my bottom half. Unfortunately, I can't find any at Decathlon.
2. FH500 Rain Jacket for to replace the FH500 Helium Wind Jacket and NH100 Raincut half-zip. I didn't use the Raincut much on this trip and I regret choosing the half-zip to save 75g. A fullzip is more versatile for breathability and casual use in european winter. I could get the FH500 Rain Jacket and ditch the FH500 Helium Wind Jacket too. On the other hand, I really liked the FH500 Helium and the FH500 Rain Jacket is more expensive at $81 euros.

3. Hike 500 Synthetic socks. I'm skeptical the small amount of wool in the Hike 900 does anything besides increase the drying time and price. [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/hiking-socks-hike-500-mid-black-x2-pairs/\_/R-p-330181](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/hiking-socks-hike-500-mid-black-x2-pairs/_/R-p-330181)
4. Osprey Exos 48 and small daypack to replace my Farpoint 40L and 26L Deuter daypack. A bigger daypack will take more space in my main pack but I could use my main pack for hiking. I could take the Farpoint 40L but it doesn't have any organisation. I also have a dream where I travel with a comfortable hiking pack and a packed daypack inside, maybe packed with a cool camera. Then when I'm at the airport I take the daypack out for a personal item and put the hiking pack in carry on. [https://www.ospreyeurope.com/shop/eu\_en/osprey-exos-48-s22](https://www.ospreyeurope.com/shop/eu_en/osprey-exos-48-s22)
5. MT500 Down Jacket. I could use it casually too because it looks awesome. [https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-mountain-trekking-down-jacket-mt500-10-c/\_/R-p-12077?mc=8611349](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-mountain-trekking-down-jacket-mt500-10-c/_/R-p-12077?mc=8611349) 
6. Update 26/9/23: Pants instead of rain pants. Lightweight pants come in at a similar weight to the rain pants and would be more comfortable in the evening because they’re not swishy. I don’t think i need rain proof pants, just something to break wind. https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/men-s-hiking-trousers-mh100/_/R-p-341636?mc=8767072&c=grey_blue

108,1695323443.0,Attachable fanny packs suggestion,"Hi all, I'm kinda new to the UL world. A proper newbie actually. I'm looking for a fanny pack which can be attached to the torso or hip strap like the [Hyperlite Mountain Gear](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/vice-versa) one but, seriously, I don't really see why it should cost that much. Also, I live in Europe so HMG stuff cost 50% more compared to the US.

Sadly I'm not a good sewer and I couldn't make one by myself even in a lifetime.

So... Any suggestion? Any brands?

Sorry if this sounded a little dumb but I'm really new to this world.

Thank you :)",Ultralight
109,1695322137.0,Lightest framed UL packs?,"[My current load out](https://lighterpack.com/)

Hiked the PCT in '21 with a Hyperlite and was fine with it.  Felt that it carried waterloads well and by the time I learned to pack my food lighter/got stronger it felt great.


Grabbed a pa'lante V2 for a '22 CT hike because I wanted to see how light I could go.  While it had some very cool features overall I felt that I missed the support of a framed pack.  On shorter carries the frameless felt fine but on longer carries + water it just felt uncomfortable so I can't really picture myself with it on a long thru hiker with bigger water carries.  

So begins my search for the lightest UL framed packs, of which there seems to actually not be very many but it seems I've narrowed it down to a few.  Looking for something I can do the CDT with with long carries comfortably but still as UL as possible with bottom pocket and shoulder pockets.  Maybe 25 oz?  Or at least lighter than the HMG.  Willing to shave off a few oz to maybe make it just 35L capacity, or have it not be seam sealed (since I have a DCF dry bag anyways)

Essentially I'd like something framed but light as possible.  Strappy shoulder pockets, because I hated the add ons for the HMG and loved the built in ones on the pa'lante.  Potential to add on hip belt pockets because I hate using a fanny pack.  Bottom pocket, but most packs include that nowadays.  

**Option 1 ([Lite AF 40l Full Suspension](https://liteaf.com/ultralight-packs/ultra-40l-curve-full-suspension/))** 

Pros:

-softest shoulder pads, tried on a curve and it felt so damn comfy

-known quality

-lots of great features, customizable

Cons: 

-potentially pretty heavy but info is unclear depending on size, could weigh just as much as the HMG

**Option 2 ([Red Paw Packs](https://redpawpacks.com/product/front-range-40/#front-material))**

Pros:

-highly customizable

-great looking shoulder pockets and bottom pocket

Cons:

-unsure of what total weight would be for a framed 40L pack

-website is a little funky to use

-unknown quality, not too much info on these

**Option 3 ([Pilgrum Gear](https://pilgrimul.com/product/highline-framed-ultralight-backpack-ultra-200/))**

Pros: 

-highline pack is basically advertised as an UL framed pack

-on paper has most of the features I want (framed, UL, hip belt with potential for hip pockets)

Cons:

-hate the lack of strappy shoulder pockets

-less customizable

-unknown quality, not much info on these

-not a fan of the velcro closure, definitely prefer the simplicity of pa'lantes roll top + single hook closure

-it's kind of ugly... superficial but it bothers me

**Option 4 (others, misc, etc)**

-HMG Unbound: I was honestly fine with my HMG on the PCT but the Elvate rings in at 30 oz and I think I can do better (and I hate the lack of strappy shoulder pockets)

-SWD Movement 35: seems to fit the bill a lot but I hate the lack of strappy shoulder pockets, and the one person I met who used the framed SWD didn't seem too enthused about it.  Superficial but the lack of white Ultra fabric bothers me.

-Bonfus Framus 48L: weight seems about right, around 25 oz but the lack of strappy shoulder pockets again is somewhat of a killer to me.  Also less of a known quality, don't have much info on these.

I've been really interested in LiteAF packs for a while and they have a lot of great features but it's hard to tell how much the final product will weigh.  Red Paw Packs seems also very willing to do some customizable things so it might be worth a shot too.  Honestly I really enjoyed the pa'lante pack and it's design, if I could just copy that and stick a frame system in it that'd pretty much do it for me.  Or if LiteAF could do a 35L framed pack (not sure how much weight that actually saves).

110,1695319705.0,Beware Craghoppers Carbon poles & any suggestions for cheap (£50 or less) carbon walking poles?,"So I only currently use the poles mostly for holding up my tent (if base camping, I am moving towards lighter proper through hiking where I take the tent with me but my gear is still so heavy cos poor), as I have a Lanshan 2 it now takes two of them, with my Lanshan 1 I use to take one with me. 

I have some good yet heavy alu Trekbuddy poles, so decided to treat myself to some lighter  Craghoppers Treklite Carbon poles which get good reviews, like in the Independent newspaper.

Big mistake - on the 5th day putting my tent back up I pulled one pole out from the pack side pocket to find the pole wasn't glued in properly to the joint - I'll post a pic in the comments - which was really disappointing on their first trip. Spoken to Craghoppers (owned by Regatta) doing the usual refund thing, but won't refund the p&p for a manufacturing defect, which I think is pretty low. Not impressed since they are a few weeks old, and it's an obvious defect rather than misuse (yes I sent the photo).

So looking to spend the refund money (if I get any?) on something else.

Now I know some will say 'get Lekis' or something, but if I had a Leki-sized budget I'd not be called 'Hard Up Hiker' on YouTube; UL is so f\*\*king expensive. And given they are mostly going to hold up tents for now, and given the pricier ones (Craghoppers are £88 RRP currently £61, got them cheaper via coupon) let me down I want to go with something cheap and cheerful for now cos I reckon all poles under £100 are probably a bit cack. 

BUT I've heard good reviews about the Karrimor Carbon poles (Sports Direct tho, customer service is even worse, they tried to sell me a pair once that were missing equipment full price hence going for he Craghoppers), and the TheFitLife poles. Anyone used those or got good recommendations that don't cost a lot of money, cos plunking £100-200 on poles is not an option?

P.S. be aware **I am in the UK**, so all the REI/Backcountry/Walmart love means *nothing* here as after all the steep delivery, customs and VAT your total bargain become the same as an expensive option (Cascade Designs Carbon poles is one of those, look great, yet they are £80-100+ here)! So many of the hiking channels and reviews are US centric on local gear (hence starting my own)....

Maybe some UK hikers are here using cheap carbon poles? I know Paul Messner swears by the Karrimors.",Ultralight
111,1695316670.0,New to lightweight: Sleeping Bag/Quilt,"Hey everyone, I could use some help figuring out what to get here. New to the lightweight game, I just got a new pack that I am going to outfit as my hammock pack and keep my bigger pack as my tent setup. 

I’ve been looking through the thread and the more I dig the more confused I get on the sleeping bag vs. quilt for hammocks.

I see posts saying that hammock sleeping with a quilt is best for lightweight but in colder temps you need an insulator under the hammock which basically just brings you to the same space requirements as a UL sleeping bag. (Hammock Gear and Loco Libre came up and they look nice but it doesn’t seem “space saving” when combined)

I also looked at the Sea to Summit mummy bag and don’t see why I wouldn’t be able to just put a pad in my hammock and sleep in that as that is traditionally what I have done with an older mummy sleeping bag I have. 

I have also seen other people use mummy bags that go around your hammock and act as a quilt + bag in one, but I am having trouble actually finding one online that is reputable - I think this is what I would prefer if possible so if anyone has a suggestion for a quality one I would love to hear it

113,1695233572.0,Shakedown: Southeastern US (Florida) 3-7 day duration 3/4 season,"I bought some replacement gear recently so I can keep whittling down my pack weight over time. Last year was a new pack. This year was a new tent, quilt, cook setup, and some froggtogg gear (poncho and rain jacket to swap out depending on weather).

My biggest items are my tent and my quilt. I can put the poles outside the pack, not a huge deal. I don't carry a ursack or a bear vault because in my area, I'm not required to, but I think it would be a good idea to start using one anyway. I do dehydrated food, so my daily food weight is closer to 1.5 lbs with snacks per day. I generally carry 3L of water at a time, but I have just lowered this to 2.5L in bottles and not using a bladder anymore. If there is more water on my route, I will camel up and carry closer to 2L. I drink around 2L per 5 miles.



Goal Baseweight (BPW): 12lbs

Budget: Don't have one will buy gear over time

Non-negotiable Items: Any starred item on lighterpack I would prefer to keep. Specifically tent and quilt.

Solo or with another person: Solo

Additional Information: I carry this gear on day hikes as well, so I'd like to reduce volume where reasonably possible. 

Lighterpack Link: https://lighterpack.com/r/zisveb

Note: Some of the gear replacements I have been eyeing are a lighter battery (NB10000), carbon fiber trek poles, and a smaller and lighter backpack like the mariposa 60. This would reduce my weight by approx 20oz and cost me $565. I am not sure if I am forgetting to bring anything major. This would get me down to 13.71 lbs or so. I am a wide side/stomach sleeper, so not sure if I can find a similar spec air pad but the one I've got works great for me


EDIT: I am ordering some water purification tablets and dropping the extra sawyer mini. I bought the NB10000 because 2 gram savings per $1 was my best suggestion after the water tablets. I dropped one of the Bic lighters only because I am confident I could use Paracord for a bow drill friction fire. I also properly marked my consumables. I dropped about 150g off my medkit, but I am buying an ace wrap for it and will have some prescription meds to add so it might equal out to be close to what it was before. I forgot I used my old ace wrap on a rib injury and never added another one to my kit. Slipped descending muddy embankment and landed on ribs, bruised badly, had to hike 3 miles back out (was a ""shortcut"" to save 3 extra miles not doing that again).

I am down to approx 12.5lbs baseweight (will do final weigh-in once amazon orders show up). I can get another .5 to .7lbs from a new backpack (this will likely be the last thing i replace once i have everything else dialed in), and if my poles ever break, I'll swap to carbon fiber to save 2-5oz. Next year, I might buy an extra tent that is a true one person tent that could trim another 1lbs. I am keeping the solar panel for now because it's 50g less weight than another NB10000, we have great sun here in Florida.

If anyone has suggestions on lighter base layers to wear, then I can wear to sleep in as my clean set of clothes that will dry quickly. I am all ears. I am a fan of merino wool but also polyster blends.

Still torn between the BV450 and BV500 or going with an Ursack. Kinda sick of hanging a bag, but I want to make sure my choice doesn't stop me from going to a much smaller back in the future. I don't want to strap one of those to the outside of my pack.",Ultralight
114,1695225970.0,Wide Torso Length Inflatable Sleeping Pad Strategy?,"**TLDR:** A torso length, wide xlite is \~3-4 oz heavier than a torso length, wide uberlite but is warmer and more durable. Which can you make a better 3 season system with?

I'm looking for a three-season sleeping pad solution and trying to balance warmth, weight, durability, and comfort. Cost is also maybe a factor especially since I'm probably going to void any warranty. 

I just finished a weekend trip with 8 panels of CCF. God bless you if you can sleep like this but it's not worth the weight savings to me. Testing using a cheapo inflatable pad that I cut down I've found that I would rather ""spend"" my weight on a wide, torso length pad than a regular width/length pad. 

I'm mostly looking at the thermarest xlite and uberlite for weight reasons and because horizontal baffling doesn't bother me. I won't be comparing comfort because they should all be similar.

Here seem to be my options (assume the inflatables are wide and cut down to \~45 in):

Uberlite (\~7oz): Lightest, r=2.3, major durability concerns

Uberlite (\~7oz) + gg thinlite (2.7 oz) = \~10 oz, Combined r=\~2.8, puncture protection, still not super warm

Uberlite (\~7 oz) + CCF (\~1 oz per panel) = \~13 or 15oz (19 oz if I want full leg coverage), Combined r=4.3, puncture protection and warmth are better, one of the heavier options

Xlite (\~10-11 oz): r=4.5, no puncture protection, warm and relatively light. 

Xlite (\~10-11 oz) + gg thinlite (2.7 oz) = \~13 oz, r=\~5, good puncture protection, warm, on the heavier side

Xlite (\~10-11 oz) + CCF (\~1 oz per panel) = \~22oz, r=6.5 (r=2 for legs), warmest/heaviest option

Questions and Comments:

Would you use either of these pads without a layer of foam beneath them? Are they generally durable and how much more durable is the xlite than the uberlite?

The uberlite would give me a more modular system, allowing me to cut a few ounces for 2.5 season trips while still having puncture protection. 

The xlite is a lot warmer, but I'm still practically limited by minimal leg insulation. How cold have people gone with torso length pads? I'm sure I would still need a true full-length winter pad if I'm going below freezing.

Which would you pick? Am I missing some other options here? Has anyone had success cutting down inflatable pads with different baffles?

I found NOTHING will stick to my Trail Pro, not even Gorilla Tape, sil tape, those pool repair patches, only a Highlander glue patch sort of worked after a 12 hour cure, taking the 1-2 hours up to 5 hours, but it still went down. Is the thing made of PTFE?

So be warned the Trail series and older Therm-a-rests pre 2015 have a film coating apparently which means only their flimsy proprietary patches (don't) work!

I have done a perm fix on the pad now, and testing it to see if that fixes it, but I have lost a lot of trust in Therm-a-rest's ability to be easily repaired.

Has anyone had experience fixing the Nemo Tensor, Sea to Summit Ether Light XT or the Therm-a-rest  NeoAir XLite  / NXT in the field? Was it easy? Also those are mega pricey for my range - paid about £80 for my Trail Pro - ex-stock as mine wasn't with the wing valve or pump bag, but found it was mostly comfortable but I slid off a lot and it's not 100% great for a side sleeper as you can bottom out as it naturally deflates due to cooling of the warm air.

I assumed that I just got unlucky and ordered a replacement, but to my surprise, the replacement is doing the same thing.

I sometimes bring my kids along so we might share the water or I might refill our canteens on a long day hike so that adds an extra layer of paranoia.

Am I just doing the test wrong? ... I reached out to Katadyn but havent heard back yet...

EDIT:

I heard back from Katadyn - 

""A small amount of air is normal. Can you fully inflate your bottle like a balloon?""

Filter Integrity Test:

* The Filter must be well saturated - Soak it for 30 minutes
* Then, put it into the flask and blow into it. 
* If the flask inflates like a balloon, then it no longer safe for use
* If you can't inflate it, then it is good. 

\- So with these specific instructions, my filter is good!

**Lighterpack Link:** [https://lighterpack.com/r/i2xcxk](https://lighterpack.com/r/i2xcxk)

I'm planning on walking the Camino Portugues (Litoral Way out of Porto, then Coastal Route once I hit Vila do Conde/Povoa de Varzim) in Sept 2024. After I reach Santiago, I will then walk to Finisterre and Muxia as well. Total trip length 22 days (gentle walking, 12-25 km per day, one rest day in Santiago). There will be a few days at the beginning and end of the trip that are ""town"" days used to travel to and from Canada.

I have never done more than a week's worth of backpacking/long hiking. I am typically a lightweight backpacker, not an ultralighter. However, for the Camino a pack weight of 10% of one's body weight is suggested. (Some of these suggestions say to include water in that 10%, some don't).

Wondering if y'all might take a look at my lighterpack: [https://lighterpack.com/r/i2xcxk](https://lighterpack.com/r/i2xcxk)

I think I've identified the fears I've packed:

1. Sleep system. Worried about being hot OR cold when sleeping. I tend to sleep hot but I understand some albergues are unheated (or they only turn on the heat when peregrinos get there), and some albergues don't have blankets. Hence the sleeping bag liner AND the quilt. Both will be treated with permethrin before the trip, because I also fear bedbugs. It's also cooler in September (12C/50F lows is my understanding), so I think I'll need the quilt. Will I need the quilt? I haven't actually bought the quilt yet, so this particular item on the list is a theoretical weight, taken from the EE website.
2. Dehydration. I'm a sweaty girl. I have the option to carry up to 2L of water with the Hydrapak Flux 1L and the HDPE Nalgene 1L, but I expect I'll typically only carry 1.5L. I could instead get two 1L plastic water bottles on arrival for a total bottle weight of approx 60g instead, which would save me 128g. I also believe most water in fonts on the Camino is treated, so maybe I don't need the Katadyn BeFree. But... I'm scairt of bad water and I want to guarantee myself a hard-sided backup water carrying method as well.
3. Clothing sets. I could have only two sets of clothing instead of three (except socks and jocks, three pairs of undies and socks is not negotiable). But if I only took two T-shirts, two sports bras, and the two pairs of long pants (no shorts), I'd save about 287g. Clothes will get washed every day basically. I'm a little worried with only two sets of clothes that they won't dry in time for the next day. I understand September can have days of rain that would prevent me from hanging damp clothes to dry on my pack. Also wondering if I need to add a puffy jacket for around town in the evenings. Dun wanna add a puffy. 
4. Boredom. I have the notebook and pen to journal. It's spiritually meaningful for me. But do I need it? I could be using my phone. Entirely different experience though. Saves 100g if I remove the notebook and pen.
5. Peeing. I have a kula cloth already. I might as well bring it? In case I need to pee by the side of the road. Better than having to buy TP along the way? Plus then I don't have to pack out dirty used TP. The kula cloth can be washed nightly and hung to dry. I'll be using my shampoo bar to do all my washing.
6. Pack liner. I've got the poncho. Do I need the pack liner? It would protect my clothes/quilt for peace of mind.... 60g saved without it.

Base weight + consumable weight (water): 12.56lbs/5.7kg.

Total weight (base + worn + consumable): 15.68lbs/7.11kg.

My body's ideal weight is approx 125lbs. My actual weight is 150lbs.

If I took out ALL of the things listed above, I'd save 884g, which is significant... but I think I've got a pretty light pack with the base weight at 9.25lb/4.2kg.

Do I need to pare it down more, or is this the happy medium of comfort/lightness?",Ultralight

121,1695041745.0,Sea to Summit (STS) hammock weight comparison rambling,"Hey!

So I got a STS Ultralight hammock XL for Christmas last year and I've never really felt that I clicked with  it. I bought the XL version as I thought I might sleep in it (turns out I probably won't) but my problem is a combination of the big size (3m x 1.5m) and the fabric itself, which feels like you ""sink"" down in it, causing the sides to tension and ""go up"" and kind of block your vision (the fabric is nearly see thought but still a bit annoying).

Also if I lay diagonally or sit in it like a comfy chair after a while the fabric ""cuts"" into the skin in a fairly irritating way.

So last weekend I was kayaking and camping with an old friend and he had the STS Pro Single Hammock, which is the same size but to me feels way more comfortable. Mainly because the fabric doesn't ""sink"".

So I ordered one, and thought I'd sell my ultralight. The thing I hadn't thought of is that with the ultralight you also get ultralight suspension straps, which are a little bit shorter but also weight significantly less (35g vs 105g for the regular suspension straps).

Then I remembered there is also the ultralight normal sized hammock, which is smaller size and also weighs less...

So now I'm contemplating:

**a.** Selling my ultralight with ultralight suspensions and accept that my hammock setup is going to ballon from 292g to 572g

**b.** Keeping both and use the ultralight suspension straps with the regular pro hammock, 437g. And potentially try to sell the ultralight without any straps!? A side question here is.. the pro hammock supports 180 kg and the ultralight 135 kg, how much do the straps have to do with this? Could the ultralight straps and the pro hammock still do 180kg  together?

**c.** Return the regular pro hammock, try to sell my ultralight one second hand and instead get the Ultralight single (not XL) version.

Or is there anything else I'm missing? Tips and tricks for the ultralight XL to make it more comfortable? Or does anyone have the Ultralight normal sized (not XL) and can comment on it?

Att (and t-mobile) cell service is okay even on trail, Verizon is crap except in Grand Marais both are good, but we found that the bandwidth is crap. Tons of water on this trail, no need to carry too much at any given time.

There are latrines at every campsite so plan your movements accordingly and have TP. If you are a bidet user, don't drop it in the latrine (I saw one). The latrines are packed in to the ground with clay, hovering or bidet use becomes a slippery situation when the clay is wet. I would suggest bringing TP and planning a full landing.

**The Report**:

On sept 11, a friend and I attempted a hike from 270 to sugarloaf TH. Both of us are Michigan natives have years of backpacking and hiking experience. I will admit that Michigan is fairly flat and we have a lot of sandy trails. We also have a fair amount of roots and rough terrain to navigate. I have racked up almost 500 miles of trail running and backpacking this year ranging from 10-20 mile days in preparation for this hike. My friend has lived in Denver the past year and had also trained in his area too. Going in to this hike we both felt confident we could tackle this section. I did my research, read the books, and studied others’ hike videos online.

&#x200B;

We created a pretty good game plan in our opinion;

Days: Sept 11-17

Mileage: 15,15,15,5 (Grand Marais nero + resupply), 25,25,12

Expected weather: overnight lows in upper 40’s and daytime highs in the mid 60’s. Precipitation possible on the 15th and 16th between Grand Marais and Schroeder (Sugarloaf) area.

&#x200B;

*Sept 11*\- Parked vehicle at Sugarloaf trailhead, met superior hiking shuttle at 8 am, dropped off at 270 and started hike at 9:30am. Hiked up to 270, back down and headed out. Ended the day at North Carlson Pond. SHT databook- 15 miles. Gaia recorded  17.45 miles in 8:56 hrs at 2 mph with 1 hr worth of breaks. Elevation gain 2,068 feet, decent 2,161 feet. Some precipitation during hike. It did rain as soon as we got in our shelters (around 8-9pm) and all night (un-forcasted). Did not hang food, could not find good tree in the dark.

&#x200B;

*Sept 12*\- Wake up at 6:30 to rain, good thing we slept with our food as we both had breakfast in our respective tents. Started hike at 8:30am ended at NW Little Brule River Campsite around 5:30-6pm. SHT databook- 31.6 miles total, 16.6 miles for the day. Gaia records: 18.30 miles in 8:49 hrs at 2.1mph with 1:15 hrs stopped time. Elevation gain 1,388 feet, decent 1,799 feet. Slight rain in morning and a couple times during day. Temps were in the low 40’s overnight and mid 50’s during day. Downloaded weather from my inreach and overnight lows were expected to be 38 with a feels like of 36 and a frost advisory for the area.

&#x200B;

*Sept 13*\- woke up cold. Wore everything I had to bed. Breakfast in the tent again, but hung up food the night prior. Got packed up and moving by 8:30 again. Camped at West Devil Track Campsite. SHT Databook 47.8 miles, 16.2 for the day. Gaia records: 17.82 miles in 8.33 hrs at 2.1mph with 1:04 hr in breaks. Elevation gain 1,948 feet, decent 1,819 feet. Mostly cloudy and temps in mid 60’s. Expected overnight temps in low 40’s.

&#x200B;

*Sept 14*\- woke up feeling damp. Sleeping so close to the river and waterfall made it feel colder and damper than it was. Left camp at 8:45am for Grand Marais. Gaia records: 5.84 miles in 2:41hrs at 2.2mph with 30 mins in breaks. Elevation gain 393 feet, decent 711 feet.

&#x200B;

On the hike to Grand Marais we decided to call it quits. We arrived in GM on Thursday and the weather for Friday and Saturday was going to be rain. Also both those days we had 25 mile days planned. We decided that after 9 hours of hiking and being completely pooped we could top 15 map miles in a day. So looking at two big days and adding in rain we came to the conclusion that making it to the car on time wasn’t possible and being late wasn’t an option.

&#x200B;

Another contributing factor was the terrain. I knew this trail was going to be hard and that mud, mosquitoes, and mountains were on the books. I had no idea how hard this actually was going to be. I’ve hike plenty on ankle tweaking root trails before, but the section of SHT that we did was beyond anything I’ve hiked. I have never hiked mountainous terrain before, so all the rocks we had to walk on were foot destroying. The sheer combination of rocky terrain, roots, wet boardwalks, muddy/clay ascents and descents, stairs, etc. this was by far the hardest hike my friend and I have ever done. I am aware that in the late spring and early summer the water, mosquitoes, and mud are a lot worse too. I read a few blog posts, watched some YouTube, and read the books. Nothing in any of those media could have prepared me for what I encountered. I don’t think there was a single easy mile in our sub 60 mile hike. Also, how hardcore do you have to be to FKT this and not break an ankle...So I am wondering where I went wrong in preparation because I’m bummed we bailed. I had Altra Lone Peaks, so was I just not protecting my feet enough? Did I not train on rough enough trail? Did I plan too big of days? This was supposed to be a ""could I handle an AT thru-hike"" hike and I feel like I failed that test.

126,1695001945.0,Top three gear priorities with $500 budget,"Hi, UL noob here. I'd appreciate your input on what three pieces of gear would you first address in my pack with a $500 budget.

I'm currently a 3-season backpacker with a ~24 lbs. BW. I most frequently backpack in the US Rockies and the Sierra Nevadas. My trips are typically 3-5 days. I typically backpack with one other person, and so a couple of things in my pack cover two people (i.e. cups for cook system). I'd like to have UL setup for my most frequent conditions.

For example: I think that the following three pieces of gear are my priorities because they will have the most impact with decreasing my BW and are within the allotted budget:

1.) Footwear - seek trail running shoes instead of hiking boots because of both the weight improvement and enhanced weight distribution

2.) Cook system - seek titanium pot that because it's lighter than SS, and ditch serving cups.

3.) Sleeping system - replace bag with UL quilt

**Gear Notes / Winners and Losers**:  

* Winner - MYOG carbon fiber rod tent stakes, made following the materials list and instructions at [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/e5j4l8/myog\_carbon\_tent\_stakes\_lightest\_in\_world\_version/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/e5j4l8/myog_carbon_tent_stakes_lightest_in_world_version/)  In the soft soils of New England, these worked great!  Since I planned on staying at shelters every night but 1, I brought my tarp and bivy setup on this trip.  These stakes worked great for that application.
* Loser - RovyVon Aurora flashlight.  This thing saved me half an ounce over my trusted Nitecore NU25 UL.  That half an ounce was not worth it.  The micro-USB charging port was a PITA, and the stupid thing kept turning on automatically in my ditty bag.  The hat brim attachment wasn't nearly as nifty as I thought it would be.  When Tina and I parted ways on day 2, I ditched this POS and borrowed her NU25.
* Winner - BRS3000.  When Tina and I parted ways, I swapped the Soto Windmaster for the lighter BRS.  my meals when solo were boil-only, so I didn't need the simmer capability of the Soto.  I also never really had any wind that would hamper the BRS's performance.
* Loser - running short liners instead of underwear.  This was the dumbest thing I've ever done, and I paid dearly for it.  See the full writeup to learn why.
* Winner - 35L Dandee Custom pack.  If anything, this was too big for my needs on this trip.  Perhaps if the temps were cooler and I needed to add some of the things I ended up ditching I would have needed the volume.  It carried like a charm.  Day 2, after Tina and I parted ways and I was carrying more food than originally planned, the pack weight probably tipped the scales at 20#.  My shoulders were a bit sore that night, but the rest of the trip it was awesome.  The back pocket on this version - made out of pleated DCF vs the stretchy material on my other Dandee - is HUGE!
* Loser - Outdoor Vitals NuYarn Tern T-shirt.  This was my mistake for bringing on this trip - I should not have done it.  Read the full trip report to learn the fate of what happened to this POS.
* Winner - MYOG pillow stuff sack and real pillow.  This is the first time I have ever taken an actual pillow.  I usually just stuff clothes into a tent stuff sack, but for this trip I wasn't going to have many extra clothes, and the tarp stuff sack was too small to serve double-duty as a pillow.  So I MYOG'd myself an 11 gram stuff sack out of 0.7 OSY, very soft Nylon.  I also bought a 230-gram ""kids"" pillow to put inside it.  This was a real luxury for me, but it made a big difference.
* Loser - I should have packed more snack calories for days 5-8.  (I supplemented that when I got the chance.)
* Winner - Quart size Ziploc bags for reconstituting freeze dried meals in, with a MYOG reflectix coozie bag.  Repackaging the various FD meals into quart-sized Ziploc freezer bags saved me 210 grams.  These bags could then be folded back and placed on the rim of my Ziploc bowl so that I could comfortably eat out of the bag without it flopping over, without burning my hands, and without dirtying my bowl.  Score!
* Loser - the MYOG replacement lid for my Toaks 550 was kind of a joke.  I never used it, and it seems too chinsy to use.  I think I could have just brought a folded up bit of aluminum foil and accomplished the same thing.
* Winner - I think the MYOG mouse cone made out of a cake pan worked great - but I don't really know.  No mice got into anything, but I don't actually know if I had any mouse pressure.
* Loser - Body Glide.  See writeup for explanation.  I'll bring it in the future, but I won't use it the way I did this trip!  (Hopefully I won't have to.)
* Winner - Beandryl dual-purpose as a sleep aid.  Helped me get to sleep!  Nuff said!

**Gear things I would change next time (other than the loser items listed above):**

* Unused items:  Rain tunic, rain kilt, umbrella, rain mittens, 3rd pair of socks, Copperfield wind shirt.  I got really lucky on the weather.  I'm not sure I would cut these, but the fact remains that I did not use any of them.
* The one night I used the tarp/bivy I faced high bug loading.  The bivy was very stuffy to be inside of.  I ended up sleeping on top of the bivy (using it as a ground cloth), wearing my Copperfield wind pants and long sleeve hoodie, and a bug net.  Given the limited usefulness of the bivy, if I were going to do this again, I'd swap it out for a bit of tyvek, an MYOG groundcloth, or bit of polycro.
* Through a pre-trip shakedown on this sub, I got talked into bringing the full-length Uberlite as it was overall lighter than the Uberlite Short plus the 4 sections of Nemo Switchback.  (218grams vs 118 + 160 = 278 grams.)  I ended up bringing the 4 sections of Switchback anyways because it served 2 other purposes - my sit pad and the back pad/pseudo frame for my pack.  If I were going to do things again, I'd go back to my original choice of the Uberlite short and thereby save what ended up being redundant weight.  (Savings would be 60 grams)
* The UL line I have for bearbag hanging is a PITA to use.  I would ""spend"" a few more grams to get some dyneema line.

I(39M) did that trip with my mother (67F). I had the tent, both mats and the food, while I left her the FAK, charger, and main soap + TP.

Gear focused timeline :

I started day one with only a 500ml and a 1.5l bottle of water (drink from 500 and refill with 1.5). It ended being very little for the 1000m climb in the 37c heat with no shade. I got another 1.5l that night. My mother was wearing long compression leggings because she thought the temperature would be way lower. And all she had was leggings, so she stole my Brooks 5"" for the rest of the trip, -120g.

Day 2 I half joked that we should take the alpine variant (aiguilles de Bavella), so we did. Awesome, but still way too hot temperatures. I ended up using the whole 3.5l and then filtering from a stream once down. Some kind young guys from Belgium gave us their map that night, +76g.

Not much for the next 2 days, we stayed at Basseta (where I lost a pair of underwear, -60g) instead of Matalza and went through the first crest section to Osciolu (where I lost the battery pack, -161g). That's the first time I had to use rocks to anchor the tent, as there was no room for the 4 stakes. That was probably the worst job i've done setting the tent during that trip, but the spot was amazing (1st pic).

Day 5 With the coming thunderstorm, we're advised to go past Prati, to Col de Verde in the valley. I did from Osciolu to Prati wearing the Z-Trail sandals and had a blast.

Day 6 Light rain until the afternoon. Used the poncho initially, switched to the Tamiami with Houdini underneath, as rain would mostly evaporate. We arrived early in Capannelle so we left around 12 to do a double. We hit pouring rain with 90 km/h guts of wind at one point in the next section. I really missed my 204g Salomon rain coat on that day. We arrived in Vizzavona 100% drenched.

Day 7 Nice slippery way up from Vizzavona in the light rain, still wearing the Tamiami with Houdini underneath.

Not much gear wise until we arrived at Manganu on day 9, where it eventually froze the next morning. It was a bit cold for the sleeping bags and my mother said she would have liked a extra liner. Grass was crunchy as we left, it's the only morning I could actually wear the Senchi after breaking camp.

Day 12 Tight fit again for the tent at Tighjettu, good thing we were there early.

Day 14 I wore the Z-Trail again, got lots of weird looks. My mother 20m back heard some say ""putain t'as vu le mec en claquettes""

Day 15 Long way down, with no sunscreen I finally burned the top of my ears.

&#x200B;

Extra random gear notes:

* The fanny pack was awesome to keep snacks.
* I did it without poles, used my mother's ones for the tent.
* Poncho is insufficient for Corsica's worst weather.
* Houdini and Senchi combined successfully replaced a puffy for camp.
* Huge tent is huge, can be hard to find room for it. Some close calls, once or twice we took the last spot big enough.
* I didn't like the gaiters with low ankle socks, they stayed in the bag.
* Solar did work slowly, but saved me a couple times. Going south to north with sun always on my back helped charging while hiking.
* People told me my shoes wouldn't last a week, they did just fine.
* 8"" tent stakes are required, also bring extra line.
* Most of the time I wore the Tamiami on the back of my neck to block the sun.
* Flexible cap was nice since I could always stuff it in my back pocket.
* The Lone Peak dried really fast, especially compared to my mother's boots.
* 3rd pair of socks was used only twice, but were so worth it.
* The Photon on the cap was perfect for the use case, just enough to go pee at night and break camp right before sunrise.
* The pack liner broke on day 5, at the bottom, I just tied a knot and it lasted for the rest of the trip.
* The polycryo sheet teared at 2 places around day 13-14 but mostly stayed together until the end.
* Pot ended up being 95% for coffee, could have went with smaller / lighter, also could have skipped the spork.
* I used headphones on / off, probably did 3 days per charge. Similar runtime for phone, airplane mode, battery saver extreme, off at night, would go for 3 days. Didn't really miss the battery after losing it.
* Filter wouldn't have been absolutely required but was a nice safety.
* At times the bag was too big. I kept one of the 1.5l bottle in the bag as filler (usually empty or half filled as backup) when I was low on food.",Ultralight

133,1694894607.0,Northville Placid Trail 9/1-9/11,"Trip report for the Northville Placid Trail (NPT) from 9/1/23-9/11/23

What: The NPT is a trail that goes from Northville to Lake placid through some of the most remote sections of the Adirondack Mountains (ADK). The ADK are known for mud, rain, mosquitos, and beautiful lakes, many of which have canoes you can use. 

When: 9/3/2023-9/11/2023

Images: https://imgur.com/a/HrLYJBx

Lighter pack: https://lighterpack.com/r/mlp79g

Mileage: 145 miles total (including walk into Lake Placid). Average of 12.7 miles per day on trail. Longest day was 22.5, shortest 4.7 (resupply day). 

Overview: I moved to New York recently and did some day hikes to get to know the area. I happened to hike a small section of the NPT and learned about it when I looked up the trail marker. Having done the PCT a few years back, I wanted to do another thru hike and this seemed like the perfect length. I could take time off work and still complete it. 

The trail mainly sticks to the lowland. This is nice for someone out of hiking shape since I won’t have a bunch of steep climbs every day. The only major climb on the hike is over Blue Ridge, which is about 1000’ gain over five miles. Most of the gain is near the top, which is steep, muddy, and rocky. Because the trail sticks to the lowlands, it gets very muddy, and several sections are prone to flooding due to beavers. This was only a major problem near west Canada lakes, which I was able to bushwhack around to avoid the hip deep water. 

I took my dog with me, a 1.5 year old German shepherd rescue. She did great on the trip, ready to hike every morning and sticking with me the whole time. She would occasionally run off trail to chase a squirrel, but was too slow to get them. She loved getting chirped at by them though. I carried her food, and had a pack on her for a food bowl, leash, and any trash I picked up along the way. 

The weather was warm and humid the first 8 days, with highs in the 80s and lows in the 50s. The last few days we had two thunderstorms, which didn’t really start until we were in camp. I am very appreciative of the lean tos that are found all over the ADK. Without them, we would have had some wet nights. They are very well maintained by volunteers that adopt them. 

I learned that when hiking in wet, warm weather, it is easiest to just get wet. I used a rain skirt to keep my shorts dry and just let my shirt get wet. Then I would hang it up at camp and change into a dry fleece. I brought a rain jacket that I didn’t use because it would have been too hot to hike it. This is a big difference from hiking in the PNW where I am from. Rain is usually paired with cold weather and getting wet can be miserable if not dangerous. 

The best sections of trail were the west Canada lakes and cold river area. They both have amazing lakes and rivers, are remote, and seem to have decent fishing. The rest of the trail is, honestly, kind of boring. I felt like I was walking the same section of hardwood forest trail over and over. All of the lakes were beautiful, but the sections between somewhat dull. 

At long lake I met a couple of guys who boated in and were camping at Kelly point. They were cool and shared sausage, beer, whisky, and shelter with us. They also had a dog which them that got along great with mine. In. The morning they shared bacon and eggs with us and we watched the 90 mile canoe race go by. Definitely a high lite of the trip. 

The bugs were mostly gone this time of year. The mosquitos can be notoriously bad in the ADK and I have had weekends where no amount of bug spray will save you. Thankfully, there were barely and bugs to bite us. No ticks either. 

Overall, this is a great trip for someone interested in thru hiking but not ready to quit their job and become hiker trash for 6 months. It is long enough to require a resupply, but short enough to do with personal time. You also get into the hiking mindset by the end and the trail starts to feel like home. 

All of my gear worked well. The frames pack carried the bear can well for the last section. I even went hipbeltless the last few days. Any further trips I make to lean tos I will bring an air pad. The foam pads are just not comfortable on the hard surfaces. I cold soaked for the first time off this trip as well. It was fine for warm weather, but I would not do it if it was cold. The simplicity was nice though. I found that ramen will rehydrate in about 20 minutes. 

All in all. Good trip. I plan to go back to some sections. Others I have no interest in hiking again.",Ultralight

135,1694878473.0,Hubba Hubba vs Hornet 2p,"Hi, 

My girlfriend and I are in the market for a new tent. I think ive narrowed it down to the hubba hubba and the hornet 2p.

I was also looking at the sea to sky telos, but I heard in some bad conditions that tent can leak.

From what I can tell these are the benefits of the hubba hubba

-Freestanding


-Bigger floorspace, vestibule and headspace


-Better doors

-More durable?(not actually sure about this one)

Benefits of the Neemo Hornet 2p:

-Lighter

-Can pitch fly first

-Lifetime warranty vs 3 year warranty

Our first trip will be the O trek in patagonia that we will be doing in 6 days so well be carrying quite a bit of food weight. We will also be doing the huemel circuit during the trip to patagonia. Ive heard theres some pretty intense winds on the huemel circuit which makes me nervous about the neemo hornet. We live In BC so most use of the tent will be within BC. Mix of wet, dewy, sunny and snowy conditions. Im looking for a tent that will serve us on many many backpacking trips for a long time to come.

This tent will be used by my girlfriend and I 90% of the time so being close isnt an issue.

Ive seen a few of the big agnes tents but they seem to be extremely thin and it makes me worried about durability. Is this true? Unfortunately due to where we live we don't have great access to checking out all these tents in person first.

Currently we are using a marmot catalyst 3P which packs over 6Lbs so we are looking for something significantly smaller and lighter.

Ive looked at many many reviews but its always hard to get a good read from reviews. Too many reviews of people who buy the tent and havent even properly used it. Looking for people who have some real world experience with the tents and seeing what you would reccomend :)

Any benefits im missing? Anything else you would recommend instead?

137,1694858699.0,My First Multiday Hike (Mullerthal Luxembourg) - Gear Review,"After many years of doing the occasional day hike, it was time to finally go out into the wilderness with nothing but my backpack and two friends. Over the last few years, I've purchased my gear for various small trips and a few more ambitious plans that never came to fruition.

**Hike:** Mullerthal Trail (Luxembourg, Europe) - Route 2 and 3 ([link](https://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/mullerthal-trail/routes))

**Distance:** 70 kilometres / 43 miles**Days:** 3.5

**Gear List:** At the bottom of the post

**Total Packed Weight (incl. clothes, food, water):** 15.5 KG

This first trip has taught me quite a bit about my gear. Considering how helpful it has been to read (lurk) about all of your experiences, I wanted to share mine. I am also very interested in your opinion...on my opinion?! Especially when it comes to my thoughts on possible upgrades.

I will only cover the main pieces and the pieces I have a particular opinion on, unless someone wants to read how much I enjoyed my lightweight spoon?

&#x200B;

**Backpack**: Osprey Exos 58

One of my most recent purchases did not disappoint! The size was exactly what I needed for this trip, enough pockets, zippers and straps for various purposes and it was generally very comfortable.

**CONS**: My hips were sore after day 1. It's the kind of pain I learned to ignore (except when strapping it on after a break...ouch) but it was obvious there's a difference between the heavier packs, with more padding, and this Osprey.

&#x200B;

**Shelter**: Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL3

While I'm using an older model and I've used it a few times before (e.g. car camping), I still love this tent. I was sharing it with my friend, who was carrying the poles. Both the days and nights were warm and dry so we only used the inner tent in combination with the footprint. The latter makes setting it up even easier (the poles can be put in the corner rings of the footprint and from there you can simply hang up the inner). It's spacious, it's quick to set up, what's not to love?

**CONS:** For my length (190 cm / 6'2""), it's a little short. Either my head or my feet touch the mesh.

&#x200B;

**Sleep System**: Mountain Equipment Classic 500, Sea To Summit Comfort Light Insulated, Nemo Fillo

This is probably the combination of items I have most thoughts about. My nights were...not great. Now, probably nobody sleeps great when it's 30+ Celsius during the day. I do think it gradually cooled off do around 15 in the early morning hours. Generally but especially when I'm not sleeping well, I tend to turn a lot. While I can comfortably sleep in any position, I do turn. Not great inside a sleeping bag, on a narrow and noisy mat, on a pillow that moves (although stuffing it in my hood solved that).

* Sleeping Pad: I like the colour, I like the valve, I like how easily it inflates with the bag, it is comfortable in any position, even my side.
* **CONS:** It moves around a lot, it's quite narrow, it's not overly long. I actually just double-checked I didn't accidentally buy a medium but it is the large (64cm wide, 200cm long - although I don't know if the specs were the same when I bought it quite a few years ago.
* Sleeping Bag: I bought this bag before I had any knowledge about hiking, camping, etc. If I had to buy a new bag now, I'd probably buy something different but I honestly don't know enough about bags to judge.
* **CONS:** I'm tall, I have large feet, the bottom of the bag is a little claustrophobic for my feet. The bag was probably too hot for the trip but, after the first night, I just used it as a blanket.
* Pillow: It's much better with a pillow than without! I think I still need to figure out the perfect hardness for me but all in all a good addition.
* **CONS**: The fabric on my skin wasn't always the most comfortable but I have the same 'complaints' about the bag and the pad to be honest.

&#x200B;

**Chair:** Big Agnes Skyline UL 

I'm approaching 40, I have a history with back pain, I want to sit comfortably, leave me alone!

**CONS:** While the chair is generally comfortable and much more comfortable than the Helinox Chair Zero, which I tried, it does (still) tend to sink in the ground, tipping you forward or backward. That's likely only an issue on soft forest ground. The second thing I noticed is that the chair is not very wide. Now, I'm not very broad-shouldered although I have been lifting weights for a good number of years but the metal rods of the back rest do start to dig into your lats. Not terribly so but not very comfortable either.

&#x200B;

**Cooker**: MSR Windburner 1.8L

I like this item a lot, especially in combination with the French press add-on for a nice morning brew. Unfortunately, I forgot the coffee grounds so no coffee for me. It works extremely well, it boils water quick and it's easy to use and pass around. The size (1.8L) was practical because I was heating up water for both me and my friend.

**CONS:** I can see the whole thing being a bit overkill (weight and space in your pack), especially when hiking solo or only having to heat up water for yourself. At 585 grams, it's really quite the weight considering the alternatives.

&#x200B;

**Filtration**: Sawyer Squeeze

After much research and never having filtered water before, the piece of gear I was looking forward to testing most was the Sawyer (I know, it's doesn't make sense). I simply bought two light (1L) bottles at the store, refilled them with water from streams and screwed on the Sawyer, to drink straight from the bottle. What can I say? It worked without getting sick.

**CONS:** After 3 days of squeezing the bottle to increase the flow rate, the bottles are trashed. Without the squeeze, the flow was very slow. It's also a bit tedious having to unscrew the filter to let air in but it's a small nuisance. Most importantly, the [ring](https://u7q2x7c9.stackpathcdn.com/photos/20/57/327262_13266_XXXL.webp) that prevents water from leaking out was kind of pressed into the neck of the bottle, at least the inside of the ring was. Maybe I screwed it on a little too tight or maybe the neck of the bottle was a bit too wide for the ring? In either case, it's malformed now and with only one spare in the box, I'm halfway to having to buy a new kit (although, with this particular bottle, it is still working).

&#x200B;

**Shoes:** Altra Lone Peak 7 (Newest model)

Although it doesn't go in my pack, I did want to say a few things about my most recent addition. After only having hiked in boots (Lowa Renegades), this is a g-a-m-e-c-h-a-n-g-e-r! Without breaking them in at all, my feet have never been this comfortable. No pain or discomfort at all...well, excluding the expected soreness from just walking all day but that's more of a tendon/muscle thing. I absolutely loved them. I was scared that the lack of support (vs boots) would bother me or cause issues but nothing could be less true. They are light, have a ton of grip, breathe well. I am never going back to boots.

**CONS:** After day 2, my calves and achilles tendon started to feel really sore. I just attribute it to the hiking itself, although I do recall having read various reviews that mentioned these same issues when first using these shoes. Something about them being zero-drop. I wear flat sneakers in daily life so I figured I have enough 'practice' with zero-drop shows. Now, I have no idea if my soreness / pain was caused by the shoes or, as said, just not being used to walking this many hours.

&#x200B;

**Potential Upgrades?**

* Sleeping Pad - Something larger and rectangular like the Ether Light XT Insulated for more 'real estate' to sleep on. Is this pad also more comfortable?
* Cooker - Something lighter like a smaller simple aluminium pot and simple stove, like a pocket rocket.
* Based on my experiences and my gear list, is there anything you would recommend looking into upgrading?

* I know a pillow is absolutely silly, not a requirement but I'm old

For my trekking poles, I only one while hiking but use both for my shelter. I shove it in my water bottle pocket while moving.

139,1694824083.0,Help me understand framed UL backpacks,"I do understand it for heavy duty traditional packs.

Framed packs give the pack structure and are supposed to better direct the weight to your hips. 

I do understand that only with a frame you can have the mesh design like Osprey levity/existing, zPacks arc etc. So if you like the comfort of a mesh back I get the frame.

But what’s up with UL packs with a frame that don’t have mesh like HMG or Atompacks or many many others? Some metal rod inside that’s often times removable, how is that supposed to help with anything?

If it’s packed to the brim everything is so compacted that the stuff gives the pack the structure needed. The stuff inside is as stiff as the frame; so I can still put all of the weight on my hips. Currently own a Atom40 with no frame and never understood how adding a frame would help with anything.

And yes I want to go straight to ultra light. Or as close to it as possible. 

For the breakdown: I will be carrying the tent, my pad and quilt, my clothing, my own stove and cooking gear and own water filtration I will probably be carrying some of the food as well.

She will just be carrying:  her own sleeping gear, water filter, stove, etc.

None of this gear is set in stone yet except the katabatic 30 with the one ounce overfill, that is already ordered.

Nothing else is set in stone. 

Pack: I really like the atom pack, it looks like everything I need but lead times are not fun but It would be here in plenty of time. 

Pad: Everyone says that get around a 5.0 if you will be at freezing temps. The tensor insulated seems to do that.

Tent: The x-mid seems to check all the boxes. I am not dead set on it if there are other recommendations. It seems like the best bang for your buck. (never set up a treking pole tent so was unsure on the amount of stakes I need). Also trekking pole recommendations would be great.

Cooking: Chose the BRS because it seems indestructible and just about the lightest. We will both be carrying one. I am gonna go with a evernew pasta pot (I think) so we can make some ramen at the end of the night. While she will probably get a toaks 750. Mostly freeze dried meals for dinner and oats for breakfast. Lunch will consist of crackers and tuna packets and similar. Not sure on sporks do they all do the same? 

Clothing: Struggling with this one. The Kuiu Peleton seems like my best option. I tend to run warm so it should be enough. With a base layer of some sort then probably sleep in the peleton. Probably bring a down vest for camp. Any recommendations are helpful.

&#x200B;

Food: most likely an ursack or canister. Im not sure how were gonna do this. Probably her carrying a large ursack. Me carrying a smaller bear bag and then putting it all in the large ursack at night. 

&#x200B;

Water: Sawyer squeeze, CNOC 2l bag and smart water bottle. 

&#x200B;

My lighter back is pretty much complete besides small things or any updates you recommend. Hers needs some work. She wants to go with the nemo disco 15 (currently sold out) , so anything lighter will be better in my opinion so recommendations for her would be great, she wants a bag not a quilt. Her water setup and food setup will probably be identical. For her pack She probably wants something of similar size to me. I have been thinking the Ula Ohm for her.

Iv been waiting for the stratospire to be back in stock but i was kinda hoping the floor dimensions would have been updated to match the ultra version. Ive been eyeing this tent for a while and want to pull the trigger but im stuck between this and the rainbow. 

Stratospire pros. Double wall, trekking pole setup, can setup the mesh separately ( this is one of the big reasons i want a double wall tent). Cons; smaller floor space but still should be big enough for a long/wide pad when used solo (86” length floor).

Double Rainbow pros; porch mode at each vestibule (porch mode looks awesome but how much would i actually use it?), larger interior. Cons; single wall, needs a pole to setup. 

So whats your experience with these tents? Help me decide…? Right now, based on what i want out of a tent, its between these two but I’m open to suggestions but I’ve been looking extensively for the past couple months and have narrowed it down to these two. I have a duplex right now.

149,1694698337.0,Why aren't there any 4 trekking pole 2 person tents?,"My phone is broken,i couldn't finish typing and i thought i deleted the post,since that didn't happen let me try to finish it. Thanks for the replys btw

Hi,i was thinking recently,about different tent designs and things like that,and how people often complain about not having much headspace in many tents for both partners equally. 
I was also thinking how it would be a shame to not use all 4 poles if they are being brought. 
I thought about making two pairs of poles where one pair is higher than the other,that way we have a bit if a Ridgeline and the water won't pool on top. 
Imagine if you had an Xmid 2 p and there where the inner zipper ends,near the floor, there's another trekking pole there,with a height of about 110cm,that way it's 10cm shorter than the Ridgeline pole. 
You could still end up with a slope on the head or the foot end,like the Xmid would have,but it would be a slightly different shape,not a triangle but something with 4 angles,sure it would catch more wind,but it would also be supported with two poles instead of just one. 

We see many manufacturers beginning to use small struts in their tents,TT Dipole etc... Just imagine having them quite a bit taller. If whe increased the footprint of the tent,made it a but longer the walls would be sloping for sure and be more aerodynamic. 

Also,4 poles could be used in a way that they are connected and made to be 150-160 cm long,that way we can have tents which are taller. Hyperlite have a tent for 4 people, forgot the name,but the pole is in the middle,imagine if you had two long poles like that you could make the sleeping space without the center pole, therefore more comfortable and also with vertical walls on two sides. You could ad vestibules of a certain shape to make the whole thing more aerodynamic. 

Now i know all this would add a lot of weight,but I'm sure that there are many people who wouldn't mind carrying that for extra space and comfort. I'm mostly thinking families etc... 

It'd be fun to see the Xmid made to be pitched at 150-160cm tall,i think it'd be a perfect family tent and something I'd buy instantly. 

Again,tents like these wouldn't be the most UL,they would just be capitalizing on UL fabrics to give people who are willing to carry the weight a ton of extra space,in my opinion that is.

You could also just bring a pair of Z flick,yes it would add weight but it's not too much,a pair weighs less than one of my budget friendly trekking poles i have. 

 Again,this would not be the most appealing to super UL folks,but those who want a bit more luxury. Also I'm thinking scientists who are in the field and need space for their gear. (This i mean with the design where you connect the two poles,you could make rectangular sleeping space and then on opposite sides add vestibules,about a meter in length which would go from the peak and split into two, idk how to explain but basically you would be staking the vestibule out with 2 stakes,kind of like on the Nammatj 2,and have big vent similar to that of the Nammatj,there are tents of similar design to what i mean here they are just not made for backpacking)

I hope i managed to explain what i mean,this mostly a mental experiment more than anything,i hope I didn't upset too many people with it. Thanks 🙏",Ultralight

  I’m 6’3, 160lbs. So tall, long and skinny. I’m also in Houston, Texas area so it’s hot, wet, humid with a tendency to freeze sometimes. I have a 20 degree Apex Enigma XLong/Wide but this thing is huge and takes up a ton of room but it’s super warm. I ordered a custom 50 degree Revelation Tall/Wide not too long ago for summer, hasn’t gotten in yet. 
   Ok, I’m thinking about selling that 20 degree and getting a 30 degree 950 fill Enigma Reg/Reg, that way I can layer the 50 apex on top if the temps get close to freezing and it’ll help with any condensation too. The way I figure, both combined will be lighter, warmer, take up less room and be more versatile for Texas weather. 
   My question finally…Anyone around my size, 6-6’3ish, slim, been in a Regular length and if so did you fit, do you think I’d fit,ect.? I’m not worried about the width so much, just that I’d fit lengthwise and be able to cinch that draft collar up around my neck. Thanks for any help!",Ultralight

The tarp was pitched A-frame on poles, fairly high (40"" front, 20"" back) and flat (sides 10"" from the ground), tail end into the wind, which explains misting.

Staking the tail end to the ground would prevent rain from entering, at the cost of making it next to impossible to sit. So I was considering adding a piece of Tyvek draped over the rear guyline, hung at the pole tip and triple staked.

156,1694611975.0,Help me understand how/why I ruined my Cumulus Panyam by washing it,"**Update:** Just heard back from Cumulus and they will fix the bag under warranty. Yay.

So I've got two custom sleeping bags from Cumulus. I've had them for years and I've washed them a couple of times without any issues. Until now.

It seems that I've ruined my custom Panyam 450 (410g 900fp down, toray airtastic 19g, 3mm zipper) as roughly 80% of all the down has gathered into only four baffles. These baffles are *packed*. Rest of the baffles have little to no down in them. The bag weighs the same as when new within a reasonable margin, so there shouldn't be any massive amounts of down lost during washing and drying. I couldn't find any tears in the walls between the baffles, but the wall material itself seems to be some sort of a mesh instead of solid fabric.

I hand washed the bag in ~30-35C water using Nikwax Down Wash. I then rolled the bag to ""pump"" most of the water out. After this I put it in a tumble dryer on low with four tennis balls. I checked on the bag every 60-90 minutes and broke some of the biggest down clumps by hand. After four or five hours it was clear to me that something was wrong as it now became apparent that some of the baffles were completely void of down. I let the dyer run for 8-10hours after which the bag was mostly dry, apart from the at-capacity baffles that were still kinda damp. The bag then dried in my living room for a few days.

Can someone explain my 500eur mistake to me? How to avoid this from happening in the future?


**Edit:** ~~Haven't heard back from Cumulus yet, but~~ it seems that the baffles are indeed open at the ends as suggested in some of the comments. This would in theory give me the ability to move the down around but it seems quite tedious. Then again, it's off-season for me, so I have plenty of time to fiddle around with this thing.",Ultralight

Tent replacement

Mods removed first post for ""high effort"", so I will add more effort?

Current lighterpack, I haven't gotten the chance to weigh everything: 
https://lighterpack.com/r/zisveb/ 


Hello all, I am looking to replace my near decade old Kelty Gunnison 2.1. The zippers have finally gone to shit, I'm sick of fixing the stretch cord in the poles, and I just don't feel like water proofing it again.


Requirements: 

Lighter, I definitely would like this closer to 3lbs.

Looking for another freestanding tent. I prefer not to use my trek poles if possible.

2 person tent. Ideally I would like it to be wide enough for 2 rectangular sleeping pads incase I can talk my gf into coming, if not, then the dog gets extra room. So 50 inch width minimum

I am 6'3 so I would like a taller tent if possible. My sleep pad is 78 inches long so that's my minimum.

3 season tent Ideally, I don't camp much below 32F.

Would prefer double walled. Rains alot in the south east US. Condensation and humidity is rough here. I try to camp in good weather so I don't need to sleep with a fly.

I have a set of MSR mini ground hog stakes I can use. They are like 5 grams a piece and work great.

Possible options I've found:

Tarptent Rainshadow 3 - if I buy their 3oz pole this fits the bill pretty much perfectly. I'd probably have them seam seal it because I've never done it before.

MSR Freelite 3 - 2lbs 6oz minimum weight, $539, overall it is about 10oz less than the tarptent. Only $160 more than the rainshadow 3.

Zpacks Free Trio Tent - this is my favorite so far, but at $568 more than the Rainshadow 3 to only save me approx 1lbs can I justify this to myself? 1lbs is alot of weight reduction but I could maybe spend that on other things.

Options suggested: 

Big Agnes copper spur HV UL2/long- don't like want 50 inch width minimum.

Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL3/long - not bad, but Tarptent is cheaper and weighs less.

Hubba Hubba 2 - not bad, but tarptent rainshadow 3 is lighter and cheaper

Six moons designs lunar duo outfitter - rules this out on Weight alone because 3.5lbs.

169,1694460947.0,Patagaonia W Trek Shakedown - Late November,"Hello /r/ultralight,

I would appreciate a shakedown as this is my first international backpacking trip so I want to make sure my gear is dialed the moment I step off the plane. I am a bit concerned about the unpredictable nature of weather in Torres del Paine, especially the extreme winds.

&#x200B;

**Background and Context:**

I am doing the W trek in Patagonia in late November. Based off historical weather data, I am expecting lows of high 30's and highs of mid 50's. Average wind speed of 25 mph with gusts to 45 mph and a decent chance of rain.

I am doing tent camping and cooking my own food. Not staying in the refugios. For many of the nights, I will be sleeping on a wooden tent platform.

&#x200B;

**Budget and areas of feedback:**

Negotiable, but around $500. I'm specifically looking for feedback on my insulation and rain/wind protection. All feedback is very appreciated though.

Here is my lighterpack: [https://lighterpack.com/r/kkftbh](https://lighterpack.com/r/kkftbh)

&#x200B;

**Specific Questions:**

1. Is a down jacket necessary? I have been pretty comfortable in the mid 30's with a midweight shirt, light fleece, and rain jacket but I'm not sure how wind factor into the equation.
2. Is a 30 degree down quilt sufficient? Wearing the same layers as above, I was warm to \~low 30s but again I'm concerned about wind. Is down a big risk with strong winds plus rain?
3. Should I opt for wind pants or rain pants? Would wind/rain pants plus thin hiking pants be warm enough around camp?
4. Given the high winds, I am not expecting bugs to be a concern. Should I ditch the picaridin?
5. What stakes are recommended for wooden tent platforms? I am also doing primitive camping after the W trek so unfortunately I'll need both sets of stakes.
6. Is it easy to purchase isopro canisters in Patagonia?
7. Any recommendations to upgrade my down jacket?

172,1694437514.0,Loss of Appetite Revisited,"I, 60 yr old guy, just returned from 7 days on the Matane section of the IAT in Quebec.  Ferocious trail with lots of uphill grinds, hiking from sun up to sun down.  The first 5 days were unseasonably hot and humid for September (27C).  And I could not eat my food.

My traditional menu is calorie dense foods - granola, trail mix of dried fruit with nuts, and dehydrated meals.  I carried enough to give me 2,400 calories per day but most of it was still in my pack by end of trip.  I thought that my appetite would kick in after a few days but no such luck.  I still tried eating but would gag and choke on each mouthful.

I blessed the Gatorade juice crystals that I threw into the pack at the last minute.  Real pick me up.  Hot chocolate was great in the morning.  I watered down my dehydrated meals to the consistency of soup in order to eat them.  I drank prodigious amounts of water such that I felt that my hydration was well tuned, avoiding loss of energy.  Thankfully, the Matane does not lack for water replenishment.

173,1694426452.0,Sleeping gear advice - Rab Neutrino Pro 300 vs. ultralight quilt (for a New Zealander),"Hey folks, long-time lurker, first-time poster. Does anyone here own or have any experience with the Rab Neutrino Pro 300 sleeping bag?

I'm a casual hiker, but in 2024 I'm undertaking some bikepacking. I was \*almost\* dead set on a quilt, but this bag seems to hit at the same price and weight as the quilts I was looking at (around 700-800g) - especially when factoring in the straps and added faff of a quilt.

Another relevant factor is that I live in New Zealand, and my options are therefore limited. The only 'cottage' quilts available locally are Enlightened Equipment (and even then, no custom options).

I was looking at importing a Katabatic Flex but the shipping and duties make it 30% more expensive than EE or the Rab. There are a few other options, including a locally-made one, but as I said above, they are all in the $600-$700NZD range, all around 800g, and the Rab Neutrino looks to have the best temperature rating.

I haven’t ruled out a quilt yet - but can anyone tell me:

(a) whether the Rab can open enough to use as a duvet if needed, and;

(b) how small it compresses? I would love to see pics.

176,1694380953.0,Is Alpha Direct redundant and/or too specific?,"These Alpha Direct 5-panel hoodies look pretty sick. I don't know if I totally understand their use case, though, and am wondering if it would be redundant to purchase one.

Sounds like they are basically a standalone layer of light fleece-like insulation, though both loftier and lighter than e.g. grid fleece.

Currently, if I'm carrying layers for a wide range of temps (e.g. high-output hiking to high elevation where I'll be climbing) and trying to be lightweight, I'll have something like:

1. Merino or synthetic base layers

2. Sun hoody

3. Arcteryx Proton FL

4. OR Helium as a windbreaker and/or rain jacket

5. Puffy if absolutely needed

If it's even colder, the sun goody is probably replaced with a Patagucci R1 grid fleece. 

It seems like my bases are already covered, and that an Alpha Direct hoodie would be redundant. However, I could probably use it to lighten my load. The Proton FL and the Helium are already redundant in that they can both break wind. If I was content to rely solely on the Helium to play the role of the shell, then in principle, I could remove the shell from the Proton FL and keep only its insulation. It sounds like that's just what an Alpha Direct is, though.

The Proton is obviously more versatile that an Alpha Direct piece, but again, if I'm carrying an independent shell, maybe it doesn't matter. Anyone gone through similar calculus?",Ultralight
177,1694371775.0,Tips for food packing during a a 9-10 days hike across the Alps?,"Hi all!

A close friend and I are planning to do the Tour du Mont Blanc, over France/Switzerland and Italy in mid-October, after the waves of tourists, with most of the huts closed down (Or at least their main parts - you can rest in the designated fall/winter areas), with the first snows.

181,1694341173.0,"Trekkertent Drift 1, 1 person tent, long term review","This is a UL 2 wall tent that uses 2 trekking poles and 6 - 9 pegs. It's made by the small Scottish cottage gear company, Trekkertent. There are very few reviews of it so I'm making this available to the community. It's 2 person brother, the Drift 2, has more reviews available.

&#x200B;

I've used it for 40-50 nights in a range of 3 season conditions. Rain wind sun humid benign. And from near-freezing to swelteringly hot. I've used it in Norway, Scotland, England and Wales.

[My tent](https://www.trekkertent.com/home/home/60-drift-1.html) is made from 20D silpoly and weighs 785 grams (27.7oz) in 20d silpoly. Pack size 25cm x 12 cm (10"" x 5""). A DCF version is also available that weighs 630 grams (22.2oz) in 0.5 oz dcf and 655 grams in 0.67 camo dcf.

&#x200B;

***TLDR***: *this is the first trekking pole tent I've owned so have limited comparisons. I've seen the lanshan 1 and Gossamergear the one and wouldn't swap the Drift 1 for them. I like it's liveability, quality and the way it copes with weather.*

&#x200B;

I actually bought mine second hand and there were no set up instructions with it or on the company's www so I looked at the Drift 2 instructions on the website and adapted them slightly.It's a pyramid style tent that uses the second pole at the 'back' to achieve more headroom the side of the inner next to the primary pole (set to 125cm) has far higher headroom than the side near the second pole (set to about 70cm).So what's it like to use?

&#x200B;

**Liveability**: I'm 183cm, 6', tall and the headroom when sitting and lying down on my 5cm thick sleep pad is ok. The primary pole can easily be positioned on a slant to make entry comfortable. If I was taller then lying-down headroom would become restricted so I think 183cm is the limit - although if I was using a thinner mat then more headroom would be available.

&#x200B;

There's a massive vestibule which I leave my shoes in. I bring my backpack alongside me inside the inner tent as there's enough width.The silpoly floor is a bathtub design that functions well to keep wet outside. My inner is mesh above the bathtub and keeps out scottish midges and mosquitoes. Marc of Trekkertent offers full customisation if you email him, eg solid or part-solid inner for colder conditions.

&#x200B;

If the ground is on a slope then I find my sleep mat can slide as silpoly floors are slippery. I use a couple of strips of rug gripper beneath my mat which really helps, at little weight cost.

&#x200B;

**Set up**: I've attached the inner to the outer layer to make set up faster - set up only takes a few minutes. Ventilation in the tent is helped by 2 vents I leave open - 1 in the peak and one at the back. I also vary the height of the second pole, raising it higher when I want more breeze (to come in beneath the outer layer). If there's no rain and no strong winds I'll leave the main entrance zip undone for extra ventilation.

&#x200B;

I found it copes well in strong winds as long as I use decent pegs (as per normal). I use long 3-finned pegs for the 2 guys that hold the trekking poles (ie the key structural element) and short finned pegs for the rest.

&#x200B;

If there are benign conditions then 6 pegs are fine but I'll use an extra 3 when wind/rain are expected. This is 2 pegs to keep the outer spaced from the inner at the head and foot, plus 1 peg to keep the rear of the tent away from the inner.As it's silpoly, packdown is a breeze. I unpeg, give it a shake to remove rain drops, then stuff it into the stuff sack.

&#x200B;

For a 1 person tent it's got a biggish footprint because of the large vestibule. I've had to pitch it on some small and far from optimal sites (sloping, curved, uneven, boggy, roots, rocks) and have always managed ok - sometimes it has looked a bit saggy though!

&#x200B;

**Reliability**: the tent has high build quality and came with seams already sealed. It's still in great condition.

&#x200B;

The only and minor issue I've had is the 20D silpoly stuffsack started to come apart on it's seam (maybe I was overstuffing?) but I sewed it up and it's been fine since. I keep my tent in my pack's side pocket and when going through brush managed to scratch the stuff sack a little (not actually a tear) - I see that as my fault. I emailed Trekkertent to see if I could buy a stuffsack of thicker material and the owner, Marc, replied, made one and posted it for free. I guess this level of service is why we love cottage manufacturers.

I generally use a polycro footprint for the inner. The silpoly floor is still fine.",Ultralight

188,1694187547.0,‘Day’ pack choice,"I’m looking to get what will mostly be a day pack.  If it could cross over for use with UL overnight trips that would be great.  My current pack is a GG Mariposa which has made justifying getting a smaller pack solely for weight reasons hard to justify as a lot of the 40L packs weight very close to 2lbs (the weight of the Mariposa).  But, it is floppy when used as a day pack and I end up bringing puffy clothes just to take up volume.

So.  A ‘daypack’.  And I get new toys :)

I kind of have it down to two.  One must for me is water bottle access as I despise bladders for numerous reasons.  So it needs low side pockets which rules out pretty much all Osprey offerings.  I tried on the Talon yesterday and tried to reach the water bottles and struggled.  For the right pack I could use a shoulder strap bottle holder but it would have to be a really compelling sell for me to go that way.

In one corner is the HMG Daybreak.  At 17L it is unlikely to be used for an overnight.  But with the long zipper enclosure it is more likely to be useful as an edc pack.  It weighs in pretty heavy at 1.3lbs.  It is pretty waterproof but not perfect.  No snack pockets on the belt. 

In the other corner is the Zpacks sub Nero.  At 30L this is more likely to be useful for an overnight.  And it weighs in at 9oz and is fully taped on all seams.  No waist belt but I’m not sure how valuable that is if you don’t have load lifters and some sort of frame.  But… less likely to be useful outside of hiking.

I really don’t think there is a ‘wrong’ choice between these.  They are just different.  I have also considered LiteAF.  For one, I want one just because of the name.  But this would definitely be for hiking only and run another $100 as compared to the other two.  So a hard sell.

Thoughts?  As I write all that out I am starting to realize that I just have to make up my mind.  But if anyone has a negative opinion about either of those packs I would love to hear it.

189,1694184000.0,Why is unlined footwear not a bigger thing?,"In Sweden, it is very common to use unlined leather boots when hiking in cold and wet weather. It’s commonly referred to as a “shell boot” - it is to your feet what the shell jacket is to your upper body. The most famous brand that makes these kinds of boots is Lundhags. Since they have no built in lining, you typically wear a thick merino sock over a thin merino liner sock.

The advantage of this setup is that when you change your socks, you take most of the moisture out of the boot since there is not a lot of things that can absorb any significant water in the boot itself. The boots are not waterproof per se but with regular waxing of the leather parts, they become effectively water proof and there is no Gore-Tex membrane that can break.

For example, it is very common to do river crossings by removing the socks and insoles and just wearing the boots bare. When you reach the other side, your pour out the water and put your socks back on and then continue hiking.

Now, these boots are by no means ultralight - they are rather heavy leather boots. However I feel like the principle could apply to other footwear as well. Instead we have Gore-Tex boots where if water leaks in, you can’t get it out because you have a water soaked sponge in a plastic bag - that is your shoe. There is also no way to repair the membrane when it inevitably fails.

194,1694134224.0,Looking for suggestions for light kitchen set up for hikes,"I'm a hiker who wants to get into camping/backpacking. The goal is to go on longer hiking trips. I'm thinking of doing long hikes like the PCT, the Camino, northern canada, or generally spending bunch of days in mountains.

What are your suggestions for kitchen set up? Most of my use would be to boil water to eat dehydrated food. But ideally I want to be able to make simple foods like rice, soup, popcorn, and eggs. Bonus point for ability to cook on fire for camping trips, but not a necessity.

I do understand that the above requirements are all over the place, and likely 1 single set up wouldn't do all those and real answer is to have multiple systems depending on the trip. But I'm a novice camper, so all suggestions and insights would be helpful.

Jetboil and other integrated system look big and little heavy. Def not too heavy, but the side of me who is thinking of many days of hiking is thinking of ultra light. Also can't use the pot on fire, or use other pots on its stove. Could use the Stash or the pans, but at that point, it's not an integrated system anymore. But also the newer lines have adjustable flame, so cooking is possible with a Minimo or Micromo .I'm thinking of saving the volume and weight.

So alternative is a small stove and a pot. Based on specs and reviews, I like locket rocket deluxe and so want to pair it with a pot for 1 peraon, say 650 to 850ml.

Weight concern takes stainless steel out of the equation. A 1 person pot alone would weight more than a small jetboil system together.

Aluminium seems suitable, but don't mind spending more money for something more durable.

I was heavily leaning towards titanium (ex toaks 750ml , prob with bail), but the handicap of not being able to really cook with it is making it hard for me to choose. I really want to be able to cook minimally. But since I've never had the chance to go on more than 2 day hikes, I don't even know if I'll end up cooking!

Again, I'm a novice camper. Perhaps the answer is 2 pots/skillet, a titanium for long hikes for boiling water where the odds of cooking is very low. And additional skillet, a different material, or a jetboil or similar design for more relaxed hikes or camps. What do you think? What wrong assumptions am I making?",Ultralight
195,1694125355.0,Trekking Pole Grip Repair,"The grip has slipped down about 1/2"" on a Helinox Causeway pole. Since Hellinox discontinued this model AND it is older than the 5-year warranty, Helinox won't repair it. It appears the grip was originally attached with two-sided tape.

* Nike dri-fit 69g :
   * Nothing wrong other than weight
* Uniqlo airism boxer 51g :
   * Light weight but fragile. with my daily using (30-45km bike commute/week) I got already holes after 1 month. maybe better use it only on trip.
* Uniqlo airism boxer mesh(maybe discontinued?) 46g :
   * Light weight but much more fragile than normal above. with my daily using I got already holes after 1 week.
* Uniqlo airism ultra seamless :
   * I haven't tried but in internet reviews some claims it's really bad once sweat. I guess because of material they used (polyamid vs polyester for normal airism).
* Decathlon kalenji (size XL) 63g :
   * The sizing is quite twisted. with M is really really tight. I need to size up to XL to get “normal” fit. Maybe this pants is designed for race running or something. size M is still ok after years use, but size XL I bought recently got hole(seam ripped) after 2 days wear.. maybe fail production or production quality is downgraded?
* merino boxer icebreaker anatomia 70g :
   * Personally I would not recommend this. expensive and fragile. after 2 months use it got worn down. although still no holes but textile got quite thinner. and against odor, unlike shirts/socks, doesn't bring so much. most expensive I bought.
* disposable pants 7g :
   * I bought it for 50er pack or something from amazon. obviously most fragile. with my experience can hold max 2 days wear. I don’t know what material is but it seems similar to soft tyvek but much thinner. obviously most environmental unfriendly. waste, micro plastic..I tried also tanga, but it was not my thing.

With all of above I haven't any problem with chaffing, sweat. But I guess it depends on individuals, activities, etc.

**Current base weight less stove & poles**: 29.15 lbs

**Location/temp range/specific trip description:** Ennis, Montana for 9 days during November. I'll be tagging along as a pack mule for my friends who will be hunting. It should be around 40F during the day and 20F during the nights. Our current plan is to hike in, set up camp, and stay around the area. I don't think we'll be very mobile once we're in our spot.

**Budget:** Open to improvements.

**Non-negotiable Items:** Backpack, Hot Tent, Tripod, Bino Harness, InReach Mini, At least a Regular/Wide sleeping pad.

**Solo or with another person?:** There's a group of 5 of us.

**Additional Information:** The biggest thing for me is going to be stay warm. We're not going to be logging miles every day. Most of the time it'll be hiking a mile or two to a spot, and then sitting there looking through binoculars on a tripod. I live in Phoenix, so I freeze easily.

I'm planning on splitting the tent and stove apart so someone will carry one or the other. Since we're planning on setting up camp for the week, I'm fine with the 3.75oz penalty for the ruta locura tent poles. If we were being mobile, I'd drop the ruta poles and use my trekking poles.

The Black Diamond headlamp works well for me. I'm torn on continuing to use that headlamp and have the 3 AAA batteries as backup in my first aid kit. compared to going to a rechargeable headlamp and a bigger battery bank. I did the math and jumping up in battery bank size would add more weight than the extra batteries.

200,1694021723.0,Niche use case of UL: paragliding-camping. Looking for tent advice.,"Hello! I've got a pretty niche use case for UL: paragliding ""vol-biv"" which is French for fly-camping. You bring camping gear and try to land where you can launch the next day (and/or hike to next launch). I'm looking for tent advice.

My experience with UL tents is limited to an older Tarptent Contrail that I've used a few nights, that I never figured out to pitch very well and wasn't very happy with. It also tore recently and I decided to get something new.

#### Camping scenarios/limitations

In my case I'm actually not likely to do many planned overnights, but I want to have the gear with me just in case the opportunity presents itself or I land somewhere that involves an overnight hike to get back. The gear is more of an insurance policy; therefore I want to prioritize weight and packing volume (have to fit into backpack for hiking along with 30 pounds of existing paragliding gear, and into the harness while flying), while having something that works ""well enough"" when it's actually needed.

Mostly camping up on mountaintops or ridges, above tree level. Usually tundra or grassy terrain, not very rocky or muddy (again, ""usually""). There could be a scenario of landing out and having to hike out with overnight, and then it might be some forest camping or something. But generally speaking nice camping spots I would say. Likely to be used in spots in India, Alps-area, New Zealand, Alaska, and other similar mountain-areas.

Paragliding is a fair-weather activity so the hope would be a planned overnight between two days would be calm/clear night as well. But there is possibility of getting caught in a storm, and since it's mountains it could be rain/hail. In that scenario hopefully tundra/grass would absorb this moisture, but could get muddy in that case.

Temperature wise, probably 40s-50s at night as an average. Could be warmer, could also be a lot colder! Last year one night in India I camped with some friends at 11.3k and it was freezing temperature. But can also camp down lower where it's 60.

Have to use Z-poles because telescoping poles are too long to fit into harness. Mine are 110cm to 125cm.

Price is somewhat of a factor but realistically the difference between $200 or $500 isn't something that is going to get in the way, as I'm hoping I can use (or not use, if it's ""just in case of landing out"") this system for many years.

####Two likely candidates
I was going to go for the [GG The One](https://www.gossamergear.com/products/the-one) because it seems like a good compromise between weight and pack volume and price. They just released the [DCF Whisper](https://www.gossamergear.com/collections/shelters-sleeping-pads/products/dcf-whisper). That actually sounds like it could work really well because it's just under 10oz (no floor, so add some weight for groundsheet/stakes) and appears to pack down nicely.

The One takes poles of 125cm so I'm good to go. The Whisper uses 130cm for the tall side so I'd need to pitch a little shorter, or get a pole extender, or get their dedicated poles or longer poles. Not a deal-killer for me if the tent is otherwise a good option.

I'm considering ordering both right now and setting them up in the yard on nice grass/tarps and returning one.

I would consider other options but I like what I'm seeing from the above (except for a big consideration about single-wall tents, in general, outlined below). Since I'm not experienced with this, I do think I want an actual tent rather than some sort of tarp setup.

####Big question about single-wall tents
My big reservation about a single-wall trekking-pole tents (not particular to any model) is this:

An interesting thing about paragliders is they can be used in lieu of a sleeping bag. You can arrange them such that you essentially have 10-20 layers of fabric on top of you, making a duvet of sorts with lots of air trapped inside (and the fabric is meant to be non-porous, by definition, for flying, so it does a great job of containing it). This is comfortable down to 30 or 40 degrees in my experience. But, if the tent is skinny (which the one person tents are) then the top parts of the glider will be almost continuously touching the fabric of the tent along the sides and bottom. I wonder how wet it would get if it’s almost continuously plastered against the fabric. Both in the case of A) it's actually raining, and B) it's not raining, but internal condensation.

When I slept in my Contrail I had a sleeping bag so I wasn't touching sides of tent. My feet touched the ends and that part of my sleeping bag got wet. Meanwhile the nights I've slept with sleeping pad + wing, I was in a 2-person tent that was 2-wall (MSR hubba hubba) so the glider wasn't touching outer wall and stayed completely dry.

Any thoughts on that? Am I asking for trouble with a single-wall tent if I'm planning on using the glider material - which will absolutely touch all around the tent - rather than a sleeping bag?

Tent Choice:
Zpacks Triplex ( older non-zip ) - worked well for 3 persons ( 2 adults & 1 youth ) in dry warm conditions but hadn’t used in severe wind and/or rain w/ 3 persons but chose because it worked well regarding the roominess/space

very windy, cold ( mid 40s ), and rainy 

Tent Pitch:
Decent but did not pull the line locks too tight due to my fear of making it too taut as to rip in the wind but the w/corners & sides pulled down very close to the ground and the BT floor pulled all the way up inside and doors as closed as I could get them on each side

For example, I can't find the dimensions of the quilts unzipped like a blanket (only girth ranges/height rages, not the actual dimensions unzipped).

I also noticed the sewing pattern is slightly different on the convert vs the revelation, any opinions or thoughts on which sewing pattern is more ideal/sought after?

Basically I can't decide between the 2 and if the extra $100-ish is worth it for the convert. I like the option of zipping 2 together like the convert offers but my boyfriend has his own sleeping bag (different brand) so I don't see that happening anytime soon if ever (but maybe?).

209,1693910989.0,Comparison of Enlightened Equipment Quilts to Naturehike ULG1000 Sleeping Bag,"TLDR; this is a long read and I just want to info dump so it feels like this huge time waste was not a complete waste.

I'm currently looking to upgrade my sleeping bag from a 5°C to a \~ - 15°C bag as I plan to go on some colder trips and I'm usually in alpine regions where the weather can change fast and is cold even in summer so I want a temperature safety buffer for my sleep system.

In my research I'm stuck between an Enlightened Equipment Quilt or a Naturehike ULG1000 sleeping bag. Therefore I made a factual comparison between the Revelation and Conundrum Quilt and the ULG1000 sleeping bag (in the hopes of justifying the higher price of EE's quilts). An important note to make is that I wouldn't consider the Conundrum an actual quilt as it has a sewn foot box and a full zipper, making it a hoodless ultralight sleeping bag. To make it a fair comparison I included the Torrid Hood in the weight and price of the quilts and included shipping, duty and VAT (to Germany) in the total price. The link below goes to the comparison which is mostly numbers with a few graphs comparing weight composition and price.

[Comparison Image](https://i.imgur.com/qdDisag.jpg)

I think the key numbers from the comparison are:

||Revelation|Conundrum|ULG1000|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Temp Limit Rating|\-17°C|\-23°C|\-20°C|
|Full Weight|880g|1115g|1535g|
|Weight Saving|655g|420g|0|
|Total Price|574,70€|648,56€|338,16€|
|Price per -1°C|33,81|28,2|16,91|
|Price per gram saved|0,36|0,74||
|||||
|Filling Weight per -1°C|42,7g|34,7g|50g|
|Relative Filling Efficiency|\+14,62%|\+31%|0%|

First of all, comparing the graphs of the weight composition between the Revelation and the ULG1000&Conundrum shows the weight saving from a sleeping bag to a quilt great. The non-fill weight (including hood weight to fill weight) is 18% of the total weight for the Revelation compared to 28-35% for the Conundrum and ULG1000. The 7% difference between the Conundrum and ULG1000 can be accounted for by the reduced complexity of the Conundrum and Torrd Hood.

**Regarding Rated Temperature (OPINION):**

I do not trust the temperature ratings for Enlightened Equipment quilts because the ""Filling Weight per -1°C"" varies too much between the Revelation and the Conundrum. The calculated number is not quantitative as the correlation between filling weight and rated temperature is not linearly proportional but I think it is nevertheless a good qualitative indicator. With the Revelation and Conundrum having the same baffle design they should have a similar ""efficiency"" in how much down-filling is needed to achieve the same rating but the Conundrum is 16% more efficient. This 16% more efficiency would only be explainable if the usage of the full zipper (turning the quilt into a sleeping bag) creates this increase but as the compressed filling below a sleeping person does not insulate a lot and you have (according to quilt users) no cold drafts, this increase is for me unexplainable.

The Naturehike's ULG1000 rating, like all temperature ratings, is probably optimistic but I do think it is closer to reality, simply because it uses more filling.

**My conclusion:**

Considering my requirements of a comfort rating of roughly -15°C the Revelation isn't warm enough, but for warmer temperatures, it is a great option as the warmer options are in stock at EU retailers reducing price and the weight saving compared to a sleeping bag is considerable.

The decision between the Conundrum and ULG1000 isn't between quilt and sleeping bag, as the Conundrum cannot be considered a quilt. So it's a decision between an ultralight sleeping bag and a budget sleeping bag. The weight savings of 420 grams is considerable but with the price extra of 310€, you can save that weight by getting lighter versions of existing gear (upgrading to a lighter rain jacket can save 100-400g alone).

Additionally, the hood design of the ULG1000 looks a lot warmer than the Torrid Hood from EE. While turning in your sleep with an attached hood is annoying, a cold head is in my experience worse. I rather wake up to change position than be cold the entire night.

In my case, I think the ULG1000 makes the most sense as I trust the temperature rating more and this safety is it worth for me to carry more weight.Open for recommendations for other quilts and sleeping bags!

**Further Ramblings:**

* I think that UL quilt manufacturers have to start doing standardized tests so that the quilts are comparable to other options. Notably,  ""standard"" sleeping bag manufacturers who also offer quilts usually do not have quilts for the lower temperature ratings. This, in my opinion, is because quilts do not perform well in cold temperatures as you do have to use them like the Conundrum stripping them from their comfort benefit a quilt has.
* Quilts are a great option in colder weather in combination with a sleeping bag as you can upgrade your 3-season sleeping system for winter but you do not just lose the weight benefit of a quilt but rather have to carry considerably more as you carry double the fabric compared to a single winter rated sleeping bag. But it's a great way to save some money and get more use out of your existing equipment. ***Question here: Would my old sleeping bag with a comfort rating of 5°C in combination with a Revelation (-17°C limit Temp) quilt be warm enough for a comfort rating of -15°C?***
* Quilts key selling argument, next to the weight, is the increased comfort by increased - freedom of movement. I am a side sleeper who turns a lot and usually falls asleep in the ""superman sleeping pose"" and I do not struggle to sleep in a sleeping bag. Yes, it is less comfortable than my normal bed but **after an exhausting hike, it's easy to fall asleep**.

I used a 0c (32F) quilt with a Z-lite and was never cold. When hiking I usually just wore my OR Helium jacket to cut the wind and light rain. Some days I hiked using my Burgeon Highlander hoodie and had to take it off within 2-3 miles as I overheated. I’m currently doing research for my 2027 thru once I’ve finished school and hear a lot of talk about puffy coats. My question is where and when is this applied? Is it as a supplement to a sleep system or an active insulation piece?

212,1693861904.0,Virga Packing Company Cliffrose 55L First Impressions,"# Tl;dr: 

The [Cliffrose](https://www.virgapacking.com/backpacks/p/cliffrose-50l-backpack-v1) is an ultralight load hauler constructed with an Ultra 400 body and ultra-mesh for all pockets weighing an average of ~35 ounces in a medium and featuring a huge number of attachment points and a modular strap system that allows the user to efficiently secure basically anything to the outside of the pack. 

The guys at Virga advertise this pack as one that “90% of backpackers could take on 90% of their trips”. I absolutely agree with this -- for a small weight penalty over the standard UL pack with fewer bells and whistles, taking this pack would be a no-brainer for me because of its incredible comfort and very well-conceived features.  This is probably my favorite pack of any I’ve ever tried (and I have tried a ton) in the sense that it’s got some features uncommon to most packs in this weight range that are perfectly suited to my use case, and because my favorite things about the pack are the ones I thought I wouldn’t like at all before buying. 

Since the photos on Virga's website are so good and most of the features easily discernable from them, the writeup will be confined to the big things (carrying comfort, unique features) but am happy to turn this post into a mini AMA about the pack for the curious. 

# Some preliminaries 
 
I’m late 30s, 6’ ~150 with a 31in waist and mild scoliosis. I hike almost exclusively in the Sierras, carry my water up front in the shoulder pockets, and use a Redpaw Flex in lieu of hipbelt pockets. I do lots of weekend trips and 2-3 big trips a year for a total of around 50-60 nights a year. I don’t know the guys at Virga at all except for a brief (and very helpful) email exchange with Ben, I bought the pack with my own money, and I have done about 50 miles with it carrying between 25 and 35lbs. 

I realize this is well below the mark that would let me give a full review of the pack, but I wanted to give my first impressions since it’s a new pack from a new maker and I’m guessing most people haven’t heard about it yet. For what it’s worth, I also think it’s a fantastic pack that departs from most conventional UL packs in important ways and so I figured a bit of info might help people who are wondering how it works. Reminds me a lot of a bigger, beefier SWD Movement. 

I picked it up as a pack that would let me carry a bunch of extra gear for friends or family while keeping pack weight down, as my main winter pack, and as a heavy loadout pack for long trips where I might be doing a lot of off-trail, bushwhacking and/or fishing. So my evaluation is on those grounds. In particular, I never tested this thing with less than 25lbs, as I would swap this pack out for another one for anything below that. I’m sure though that it would carry like an absolute dream considering how comfortable it is at 30. 

[A few photos here](https://imgur.com/a/d70mIcS). I didn’t take many because I was lazy and the photos on Virga's website are pretty good. Took a couple short videos to show how deep the pockets go. If you want photos of something else just ask in comments below and I can them to the album. Obviously can say nothing about durability yet, the Ultra 400 feels very bomber though and the stitching and material that are taking a lot of stress are super beefy. I didn't weigh it while new, but it currently weighs right around 35oz with trail dirt and side compression straps. 

# Overall design

What I loved about this pack was that despite its low weight, the strap system gives the flexibility to carry a ton of different loadouts in a way that won’t be a pain in the ass to manage while actually on trail. Also, I was skeptical that the inversion of typical UL packs (i.e. from larger circumference on the top and smaller on the bottom to the opposite) would make a big enough improvement to justify the greater difficulty in packing. I was dead wrong. After the first couple packing I found the inverted shape to be a non-issue and while the inverted shape is not the only thing that makes it carry so nicely it’s definitely a contributing factor. And since I throw my quilt and all my down stuff loose on the bottom anyway, the flared bottom was slowly filled in by the down as I compressed it with additional items. 

The other thing I thought I wouldn’t like are the gated clips for all the connections points (even the shoulder strap). I just didn’t think the ability to swap out something like a damaged shoulder strap or webbing strap (or for MYOGers, to throw on their own) was worth the additional effort of manipulating the gate clips. Was wrong on this score as well, mainly because although it’s hard to tell from the photos the clips are different depending on where they are. The ones at the hipbelt are nice and flat with an outside-in closure. The ones on frequent-use connections (like the top straps) are beefier but easy to pinch to get open. The ones on the shoulder straps are the least forgiving, and people like me with double-jointed fingers (or just low hand strength) will need to put a bit of effort to get them on and off. But the only time you’d have to do that anyway is to replace a strap, to adjust the torso size, or put on shoulder pockets. And given how important these connections are and how much stress they take, I don’t think I’d want anything less sturdy there. 

Finally, the floating hipbelt is fucking amazing. I’ve used floating hipbelt designs before but only with single stays. Because of the horizontal portion of the box frame, the floating hipbelt takes load at all three connection points. The effects of this are like magic: it has that really free feeling of a floating hipbelt but with the weight transfer and security of a sewn-in hipbelt. I would pay the weight penalty to have this setup on a pack of basically any volume 30L or above. In fact, I don’t think there’s any loadout above like 15lbs that wouldn’t be significantly more comfortable and fun to carry. I’m actually getting sad right now thinking of not having the Cliffrose setup when I take my low volume pack out :( 

# Carrying comfort

Thanks to its really robust frame and the floating hipbelt, the thing carries like an absolute dream. Without heavy, bulky items or epic amounts of water I’m not sure you could even get enough weight in 55L of volume for it to be uncomfortable (at least beyond the unavoidable discomfort of simply carrying 40lbs). Not really sure what more to say about it. The shoulder straps are super comfortable but still feel plenty durable. Because the shoulder strap connection points are on the top horizontal bar of the frame, Tightening the shoulder straps will also accomplish the same thing that tightening load lifters does on a normal pack. I actually thought this was great, as tightening my shoulder straps means I’m wanting to carry more on my shoulders anyway. It also means that the shoulder strap doesn’t wrap around your traps much if at all (if the pack is the right size for you anyway), meaning more of the weight falls on my upper chest. With the caveat that I’m in decent backpacking shape now so my shoulders are used to carrying some weight, I felt no discomfort whatsoever on back to back hiking days. 

For bear can carriers (me for most for my trips), the pack has an extra cool feature due to all the attachment points: you can use the bottom set of webbing loops (the ones where the mesh pocket ends and the ones right beneath the hipbelt attachment) to carry a bear can on the bottom similar to a Bears Ears. The wrinkle is that you have to put the bear can on while the pack is empty but that’s a small price to pay IMO for those who like to carry their bear cans with the food in it rather than empty on top like I do.  The only disclaimer is that I haven't tried this will a full bearcan, will give it a shot on a trip in a couple weeks and report back. 

# A few things people might wonder about

**Pocket depths**. Yes, the side and front pockets extend beyond where the mesh stops all the way down to the bottom of the pack. In the side pockets, this feature is great for long water carries and means I can put long things like a fly rod in there and have it be super secure. It’s even better for people who want to use a bladder system without the fuss that refilling it requires when carrying it in the main compartment (and the risk it explodes all over your stuff). I’ve actually been experimenting with using an inline filter + reservoir system since getting the pack -- you can feel when you get low by just reaching back, removing what IMO is the biggest advantage of the bottle system.  In the front pocket, though, I could see the depth being an issue if you are carrying small slippery things in there while the main compartment is empty, as small items are prone to slipping down below the mesh where you might not notice them. This happened to me once and I felt very proud of myself after realizing that is where my battery went. But what’s nice is that when the interior has stuff in it the pocket will hold everything in the mesh pocket naturally so you’re not always reaching down into the lower reaches. 

**Ultra mesh**. The ultra mesh is significantly less stretchy, which means less volume. The tradeoff of course being that it holds small items much more securely and can help you distribute weight more evenly vertically along the pack. This is a pro of the pack for me but will probably be a con for some. 

**How is the torso adjustable?** The torso adjustability comes from the fact there are two separate webbing loops for each shoulder strapped, one higher and one lower. Hard to see in my photos so thought I’d mention it. 
Re: sizing, I’m ~19in torso but find packs more comfortable when I downsize, think it’s because I like to carry weight more on my shoulders than most people. I went with a small for that reason but am planning to grab a medium to compare and then sell the other. 

**The compression cordage**. It is not shock cord. I strongly prefer this whenever I’m hanging anything with actual weight off the back, lets me keep cinch the weight real tight against the pack, but people who like more stretch will have to swap it out.  


That's all I've got for now. Like I said happy to answer any questions people have, will check back here occasionally and will update the review when I have enough miles to assess things like durability. Am guessing that will be a while, won't be using this thing regularly for another couple months at least.",Ultralight

217,1693830600.0,Purchase : Atom or Atom+,"Hi all,
This comes from a hiker who wants to take up more challenging hikes on technical terrains. 
The base weight of thru hiking is 4 KG and if I need to take rock climbing equipments (taking ultralight - not confirmed), the base weight may increase to around 6 KG. 

In that case, the total weight of my backpack with food and water goes over 9 KG. Does it mean that I should not consider Atompack and look into Atom+. 

Being a petite person, trust me the range of 10-13 or more that is not feasible and realistic for me. 

I am a bit undecided. How uncomfortable it can get if I carry Atom backpack a bit over 9 KG but below 10 KG? Should I consider it, or due to comfort aspect consider Atom+ for extra 500-750 gram?

218,1693830273.0,SWD Long Haul 40 vs Durston Kakwa 40,"I know these two items have come up in a lot of recent posts, but the sticking point for me deals with the internal frame construction:

I currently have the SWD Movement 35 and love love love it -- it's just that the ergonomically shaped single aluminum stay really seems to cut into the purported pack volume, so I have a trickier time loading this pack than I have other packs with 35L internal capacity. For that reason, ""upgrading"" to the SWD Long Haul 40 would seem to address the issue.

The Durston Gear Kakwa 40 should also help with the pack volume issue and is a bit more affordable than the SWD, but I would like to hear about someone's experience with the internal frame. I used to have a ULA Ohm but disliked the ""horse collar"" sensation of their carbon fiber hoop frame. Maybe it is was just pilot error when it came to measuring my torso, but I would notice the frame when hiking, and it sometimes felt restrictive. The Ohm would also still have a ""barreling"" effect, and the design of the Kakwa frame seems similar to the Ohm.

So: those of you with a Kakwa, what do you think of the internal frame? Would also love your thoughts on the hipbelt, as I can't imagine anything being more comfortable than the SWD floating hipbelt.",Ultralight

There's not a huge amount of info on the tent online and the setup instructions from MLD are poor, so hoping I can gather some general duomid / mid advice and wisdom from those that have it... especially:

* **Pole:** What’s the ideal height? 160cm? Pole extender or two poles strapped together? Seen a variety of configs, some with pole tip down in the ground and second pole flipped so tip goes into the apex, some the other way with grips on the ground and in the apex - which is more advisale? Does it matter?
* **Guy lines:** Lengths? Use the line supplied or buy linelocs with adjusters? What's the benefit of an 'eyebrow' set up over separate guys?
* **Pitching:** Any advice on how to get the best pitch? How to avoid the corners 'bowing' and making a curve - one I'm struggling with! I'm also new to mids - which end pitches into the wind?
* **Inner:** The bathtub feels very flimsy and can see it having a short life in the Scottish highlands - if you've used it, how has it fared and should I buy a groundsheet? Any comments on optimal set up? also why is there a reinforced circle in the middle of the floor?
* **Cooking:** Does the top vent make it safe enough to use a gas stove with the door zipped?

Finally and a more general Q - I hike a lot in winter in snow-less but frozen ground, groundhogs etc. are completely useless so I usually use rock or wood anchors. This has never been an issue with a freestanding tent. With the low clearance on the duomid xl I'm not sure how I'll work this out - any ideas or peg recommendations?

Comparing the current 25 degree lineup;

The 900 fill WR looks really intriguing and I was ready to go for this one until i realized it only has a 1/2 length zip. Not totally poo-pooing that idea but wonder whether I'd miss being able to open it up completely.  Like the idea of  the outer fabric being a bit tougher and water resistent, while still maintaining a stretch baffle-less inner.  Pricey.

The 800 fill seems like a a good next step to pickup a full zip, a little cheaper but the superlight weight outer 10 denier outer seems really fragile (and almost see through). (I live near a Montbell store so I've felt them all in person). 

The 650 fill still has the traditional spiral stretch baffled design, 30 denier outer, full zip and much cheaper - but it also starts to get heavier and larger to pack down. 

I know everything is a tradeoff ie, cost, weight, durability - so i'm looking for folks to chime in especially if you own the 900 fill WR. How do you like the half zip?  Or the 800 fill - how's the durability? I'm a side sleeper but like the stretch.

224,1693752473.0,Shoe advice for bruised feet,"Hi all - walking from Lands End to John o'Groats in the UK at the moment. For context I've done about 500+ miles in my Altra Lone Peaks 7 (swapped from boots after the first couple of weeks due to ankles getting bruised) which have been great and held up well, but my feet have started to feel pretty bruised at this point due to the rougher terrain as I've progressed North and the lack of padding.

Therefore I'm probably going to swap to a more padded shoe - at the moment I'm thinking the Altra Olympus 5 (despite some of the durability issues commonly reported) given the level of padding they provide (albeit without a rock plate), the fact that my feet and muscles seem to suit the Altra style of shoe, and my walking style doesn't seem to have caused any issues with the uppers on my Lone Peaks. I'm worried about issues with blisters if I were to swap to another brand of shoe (e.g. Topo).

Will be hitting the West Highland Way in about a week and a half, and then probably through the Highlands after that.

Wanted to sense check this decision in case anyone had any comments/strong opinions against/any other advice on healing bruised feet (not keen to swap to different insoles either, again due to blisters - my feet seem to develop these very easily normally).

I do understand what it technically means when a jacket has e.g. 5000mm however:

 I recently went on a trip where it rained for a few days non stop. Nothing extreme but still light to heavy rain. I wanted to get a ""nice"" UL rain jacket for  this trip but I was just overwhelmed and couldn't decide so I just brought what I already had which is the decathlon rain cut. For those who don't know it it's something like a poncho/hoody. It's like 10€ and around 250g and they state 5000mm hydrostatic head

And it kept me completely dry. Breathability was also nice I guess since it's a relatively wide and open cut that helps

But now I'm asking myself if a 5000mm raincut kept me completely dry during multiple days of rain (again light to heavy) what's the purpose of going with a 20.000mm jacket? Sure I can save a few grams and maybe it's more breathable but in terms of rain protection?

Not trying to mock any expensive jackets I am seriously curious about the 5000mm vs. 20.000mm.

Same thing with tents my tent is rated (I think) with 5000mm and didn't leak at all during non stop rain in the night and I also think I never saw a tent with a very high rating but all of them seem to be waterproof so 5000mm seems to be enough? Why go for a 20.000mm jacket then?

I’m 6’1 and about 215lbs with broad shoulders. Typically sleep on a Nemo switchback with a katabatic flex 30. Most trips are in MN/WI/MI. I find that in my X-mid 1p my head is usually right below the mesh and my feet are centimeters from touching the mesh.

Upon researching the two tents, there are a few obvious benefits to each.

ProTrail Li: 
Cheaper,
smaller footprint,
wider interior,
vertical (not near vertical) endwalls,
and mesh protecting footbox from tent walls

X-Mid 1 Pro:
Side entry,
ease of pitch,
adjustability of pitch,
more length to fully sit up in,
and smaller packed size

I’m leaning towards a protrail, due partly to cost and also the wider interior. I like having horizontal space in tents and I find that in my X-mid 1p regular there isn’t much horizontal space for someone of my size.

Also, I think the larger width of the protrail effectively negates the dual vestibule advantage of a Pro 1, as I also just don’t have that much stuff to fill 2 vestibules. 

However, the X-Mid Pro 1 seems much better for ventilation, and side entry is definitely more ideal, along with the ability to sleep in either direction.

232,1693622834.0,How to fix a small cut in a Katadyn BeFree bottle?,"During my last hiking trip, I slipped while going downhill and fell down on my side where my Katadyn BeFree bottle was stored in one of the side pockets of my pack. It must have brushed against the rocks on the ground when I fell, because there’s a small cut (a vertical line) in the fabric. It’s annoying, because there are small droplets of water that just keep on dripping from it, and one side of my pack eventually becomes completely drenched after a few hours of hiking. 

I tried using heavy duty tape, including duck tape, but it’s not working because : 1) the tape isn’t sticking to the fabric, 2) as I drink from the bottle, the fabric of the bottle shrinks under the tape and the hole isn’t covered anymore.

I went to an outdoors store to buy the “Seam Grip WP” glue in an effort to “plug” the hole with it, but the guys at the store advised me against using that glue to seal the hole as it could be toxic… so I didn’t do it. They told me to buy a new bottle part (the filter part is new, I just bought it), but honestly I’d generally rather fix stuff when possible. 

Any idea how I could fix this cut in the fabric? Anyone here has done that before with their Katadyn BeFree bottle?",Ultralight

238,1693575447.0,Silicone tip for long handle titanium spork/spoon,"I love my long handle titanium Sea to Summit spork but it's not very efficient at scraping down all the food from my pot when cleaning it after cooking. This is the main reason why I avoid cooking in my pot as much as possible and only boil water in it, then combine with food in a separate bag (reusing the container from freeze-dried camping meals or a Ziploc bag). But that approach is not ideal either since using the same bag can get nasty after a while and it's prone to getting punctures from a spork which means I have to replace it often.  

So I'm looking to get a better utensil that would make cleanup easier and thus make me more willing to cook food directly in my pot. I want to switch to a spoon that would have closer contact with the surface of the pot (since it doesn't have the fork prongs). I'm currently between 2 options: GSI Outdoors Essential Spoon Long and TOAKS Titanium Long Handle Spoon with Polished Bowl. I like the idea of having a flexible silicone tip that would cleanly scrape all the food remains from the pot and make the cleanup with add-water-and-drink-it method easier. But I also like the durability of the titanium spoon instead of plastic that is prone to breaking easily. So ideally I'd love to have a combination of both titanium and a flexible silicone tip. Even better yet, I'd love to be able to attach a small silicone spatula tip on the handle side of the titanium spoon, so that I can still eat from a polished bowl but have the convenience of using a silicone tip when cleaning the pot. I'd appreciate any suggestions on where I can get something like that!",Ultralight

You only need 1 cook set per 2-3 hikers, one IFAK per group, one water filter, etc. talk about drastically cutting your average base weight.

From my research it seems like there’s maybe some benefit to doing it ASAP and I’m feeling really stressed out by the decision. Also just feeling quite bummed about the whole thing

That is, when compared to a network like Iridium, which has truly global coverage, including the oceans.

The BA Zoom UL looked promising too, but have heard that it sleeps much colder than you'd expect given its claimed r-value.

I'm curious to know if anyone has used the Rapide SL at very cold temps, and how it performed?

My ""safe"" selection is an Exped Ultra 5R, but the rumored comfort of the Rapide has me wondering.

I'm not interested in the Neoair pads as I find horizontal baffling uncomfortable. Also, I'm 6'5"" so Nemo pads are out.

I'm currently using a StS Comfort Light Large which I generally like, but find a bit narrow where my arms fall and they tend to end up dangling, so the rectangular shape of the Rapide SL and the Ultra 5R appeal to me. That said I know rectangular pads tend to run a little colder due to more surface area exposed to the cold air, so I'm particularly interested in hearing your feedback.

Both suffered from delamination in high pressure areas  - under my pack shoulder straps and at the base of my back. After delamination then leaks began. The jackets were (1) a 3 layer runners jacket [Alpkit - gravitas] and (2) a silnylon non breathable runners jacket [Ultimate direction - deluge, 20D Nylon Ripstop with Silicone outer and PU inner face].

The **Klymit Static V insulated** has always been comfortable to me as a side/stomach sleeper. I know the listed  R-rating (4.4) is inaccurate, but I have previously used it during freezing temperatures. I feel this could be one of the best areas to upgrade. 

The **Cumulus** quilt was purchased during their garage sale. It is an oversized and overstuffed quilt with a listed comfort rating of  1 Celsius or 34F. It is extra wide and extra long. This means I can easily fold the upper part to have some extra insulation around my core.  Compared to their regular sizes, it is relatively heavy, yet extremely comfortable and versatile. I would rather not change this.   


The **Durston DD40** backpack has been a great introduction to ultralight backpacks. I still enjoy it, but have considered upgrading on numerous occasions. I almost bought the upgraded Kakwa 50L last week, but I want to keep my options open. With shipping and import taxes to Belgium, it is less competitive than in Canada or the US. I have been thinking of saving up for a custom **Atom Packs Mo**. or **SWD Long Haul.** Primarily looking for more comfort (thicker straps and better load capacity) and better organization (better hip and shoulder pockets).

Me and my girlfriend are in a process of completing our tight budget ul backpacking kit. Now it came the time to decide what sleeping mat we want to invest in. Naturally Light Tour / Naturehike 5.8 sleeping mat is our first choice but we have some concerns: 

1. Will two of these mats fit in Lanshan 2 head to head? I'm asking someone who actually tried fitting two matts of this size in the Lanshan 2. From official numbers I can tell that they will fit head to legs but it is common that mentioned specs can be stretched a little bit.
2. Did any of you fellow backpackers who tried this mat have any problems with durability?
3. Is there any alternative to this mat with similar specs (R 5.8 and 540g / 19 oz standard size) at comparable price?

272,1693093400.0,"GG Gorilla, SMD Swift V, and ULA Circuit: Comfort at 25lbs+?","**Can anyone speak to how these similar packs carry heavier loads, particularly in terms of comfort on the shoulders?**

I would likely opt for the Vest Harness on the Swift V, and S straps appear to be the move on the Circuit. Gorilla comes in one flavor. I watched the Tara Treks YT comparison video already and did not find it very useful.

They're all on my shortlist for being \~50L, sub-$300, internally-framed, well-regarded, decently light, and having no custom lead times.

If there are better options fitting all of those criteria, I would also love to hear about them.

My main concerns re: weight/comfort are:

* I need to keep weight off my shoulders for comfort. I have a titanium plate bolted across my clavicle from a past fracture, and minimal pads can be hell with heavy weight and long days
* I hope to do more desert trips, which can involve heavy water carries. Even under normal conditions, I run thirsty and prefer to carry at least 3L for a full day of hiking if there are no resupply options.
* My current gear is definitely ""light"" rather than true ""ultralight.""

One secondary concern is durability. The ULA is 400-denier, but the other two are only 100-denier (or $100 more for the 210-denier Swift X). I don't baby gear, and I go where the rocks and spikey plants live.

Another concern is breathability/warmth. I overheat, and the Gorilla is not well-rated for breathability. However, I wonder about the breathability of a vest harness on the Swift vs traditional straps.

I don't want to go the Osprey-esque route. Major brands don't pad their UL packs enough for me, and the comfortable ones are heavy as sin. I thought the REI Flash 55 might hit the sweet spot, but the hip belts are way too big, even in the small (32in, I need 28-30in).

*Gear weight context:*

*I don't have a Lighterpack prepped to show, but my remaining 2 of the Big 3 are:*

* *Shelter: 2p BA Copper Spur HV UL / 1p REI Quarter Dome / Hammock w/ Bugnet and SilTarp*
* *Sleep: REI Joule 23 / Costco Quilt DIY; Thermarest NeoAir Xlite / BA Insulated AXL Air / Exped SynMat UL*

*Other gear is similarly positioned (individually could fit in an UL setup, but not optimizing every ounce). Kitchen includes BRS3000 and Ti/Alu cookware. Clothing includes RAB Microlight down puffy, R1 fleece, merino base layers, Altra/Topo footwear, etc. Middle of the road kit, I think y'all get the picture.*

273,1693078255.0,Wonderland Trail #35: 8/21-23/2023,"I wanted to do something different for my 35th transit of the Wonderland. Well, I got my wish. After a year of productive cycle training and some warmup hikes, I was ready to attempt a 48 hour transit. It was a stretch for sure, but one never knows until trying. After delaying a week due to hot temperatures, I departed for Mt. Rainier on a Sunday afternoon and secured a walk up permit at Longmire. It had one camp on it; Cataract Valley. I was aiming for one rest period during this endurance attempt.

  
Generally the west side of the mountain is the toughest, packing a lot of elevation gain and loss into those miles vice the east side. With my Longmire start, I wanted to get the hard part done with fresh legs and set off on a clockwise trip. Usually I do these trips with a pristine weather forecast in hand, but with other matters pressing I went with “good enough”. No rain was forecast on Monday (August 21) for my start. However, smoke was present but was supposed to diminish by Tuesday afternoon. Temperatures were moderate. I set off from Longmire at 4:20 AM, hoping to return by 4:20 AM on Wednesday for that 48 hour window.

  
I felt in the pocket all day, breezing up the climbs and trotting the downhills. There’s a lot of that on this trail. I could gauge my progress based on many past hikes, and was very pleased with the pace. I’m usually transiting Silver Forest (right before Golden Lakes) in the dark, but on this day I passed through at 4 PM, hours ahead of any other hike. Sure the skies were ghostly with the smoke, and views of the mountain were suggested, hiding in the veil. But cool temperatures and otherwise pleasant conditions were enjoyable and conducive to fast ambulation. It looked like I was going to be able to transit the Mowich Rivers before dark, another first. The ranger who issued my permit reported that the South Mowich River main channel merged with the North Mowich further upstream, in essence cutting out half the crossing problems. When I arrived with plenty of light left, there were a few slighter branches of the river in the south channel, but otherwise the huge flood plain was lonely. I passed old bridges mired in sand and rock on the way until gaining the wooded area that is home to the South Mowich River Camp. From there the path proceeded back into the flood plain for quite some distance until finally crossing the merged rivers. This whole area seemed kind of convoluted and I’m sure next season will have the rangers out there making new rock lined paths, but for this year it worked well. I have transited these rivers in the dark, and being able to see more than 50 feet was a pleasant change. 

  
I started the climb to Mowich Lake with light still with me and arrived there at 9:30 PM. This would be a stopping point for a normal 3 day hike but I launched off into the night, taking the Spray Park Trail (last year I did the Ipsut Pass route), what I call the High Route. There was no moon but I occasionally turned off my headlamp and enjoyed clear starry skies, thinking that the forecast was spot on and that the next day would be nice….with the next day only a few hours away. This alternate route over Spray Park is not easy going or conducive to fast trotting, what with big steps along the way and a somewhat difficult path through Seattle Park above treeline, especially in the dark. However, physically I was still hanging in there with plenty of gas in the tank and steely feeling legs. I arrived at Cataract Valley Camp at 1:30 AM and occupied site #1. I hung the food bag and laid out my sleep system, which I had “upgraded” last minute to an OR Helium bivy and a Nunatak 40 degree quilt, along with a NeoAir XLite NXT short pad. I just rolled the whole shebang into a bundle so I could lay it out for immediate deployment without dealing with individual stuff sacks. I’m a side sleeper so the short pad, at 66 inches, was perfect for a bent knee position. Unfortunately, I had a hard time falling asleep, and I only got perhaps 2 hours of rest out of my 4 hours reclining. I was up and exiting the camp by 6:30 AM.

  
Day 1 had me 47 miles into the hike with 12,500 feet of elevation gain. Day 2 would be longer with essentially the same elevation gain, mitigated somewhat by the last 30 miles abating a bit. As the skies got lighter I could see that there was no clearing; the cloud deck was low and mist was in the air. At least the smoke had cleared out. I was anticipating 4 major climbs to finish off the trip, and I arrived at the top of the first one (Mystic Pass at 6000’) feeling OK. I didn’t have the prior day’s spring and spunk but my legs were still in the fight and I was able to trot the downhills without quivering thighs. I breezed through Mystic Lake, around the Winthrop Glacier and saw an elusive Marten on my climb to Skyscraper Pass, the second climb of the day. In the forefront of my mind were the time milestones, and I was thinking I was maybe 2 hours behind where I should have been. I took a long break at White River Campground, the other spot that I use for a typical 3 day, and launched into the unknown. On the trail to Summerland I laid down and took a 30 minute nap, feeling much better for the short rest as I approached the highest point on the trail, Panhandle Gap at 6800 feet. But what’s that I’m seeing in my headlight as I’m hiking?….looks like big dust particles…or light rain. I am always assessing conditions, not just external but how my body is holding up. As the rain increased in intensity there was more assessing. As the winds picked up above Summerland and sideways mist was hitting my face there was more assessing. A decision had to be made, do I commit to Panhandle Gap and the exposed Ohanapecosh Park transit? Now I was not going “stupid light”, I had minimal but effective kit (total carried weight including food and water was about 12 pounds), and I was confident in my choices. Bottom line though, I deemed it prudent not to continue at that point, and knew my best place to shelter was below Panhandle Gap by the green tarn. Abandoning my 48 hour quest, I laid out the bivy on a durable, sandy area near the tarn. By the time I was tucked inside the rain and wind had intensified. Problem was, I had to keep the bivy closed because of the wind driven rain, but the condensation buildup inside became its own problem. I had all my clothes on and was able to maintain minimal heat throughout the night, but I was certainly not comfortable. Shifting side to side, occasionally opening up the bivy for ventilation, adjusting the quilt as best I could for drafts, I spent the night snoozing and awaiting morning. Stats for this second day: 29 miles/8300’ elevation gain.

  
At some point the rain stopped and I was able to expose my face to breathe outside the bivy. I was up and on the trail at 5:30 AM, wearing all my clothing. First order of business was to raise my body temperature. A shoutout to Timmermade; I didn’t have a puffy but did have the Alpha Direct hoody, and paired with a prototype silpoly Megazip shell, I was able to hike quickly but dump heat and moisture by managing the huge zips in the shell. By the time I hit the Gap I was toasty enough to remove my hat, eventually stowing the hoody and shell in exchange for an Enlightened Equipment wind shirt. This whole transit through Ohanapecosh Park was void of any views as the skies were still completely socked in. I still hadn’t seen the mountain proper on this trip. Visibility under the clouds was good, however, and I was able to peer down on Indian Bar from the ridge, my next destination. I was happy to see that the weather was not getting worse.  
By the time I descended to Nickel Creek the skies were starting to clear, making me wish I had started the trip a few days later. But hey, deal and cope, and enjoy being outside. Fatigue was slowly creeping into the legs, but I was not anywhere near pegging the needle on the sufferfest dial. Reflection Lakes was the end of my last climb, and the skies were mostly clear with my first view of the mountain. From there it was a cruise back to Longmire, arriving just before 6 PM; time to take a hot shower and enjoy some bison meatloaf at the Inn. At this point I’ve probably done around 25 three day Wonderlands, and I’ve never arrived in daylight on the last day. Then again, my last day has never been this short: 27 miles/4600’ elevation gain. That would make this hike my fastest three day hike I’ve ever done, more than 30 years after my first. I’ll take it, I aint gettin’ any younger…and there’s always next time.",Ultralight

275,1693043640.0,Getting weather forecasts via text?,"Now that the motorola defy satelite link is becoming widely available there is only one question for me. How do I get weather via text? 

Ironically text based weather forecasts used to be more common but with all the obsession with apps for smart phones text based interfaces seem to have gone to the wayside. 

I could get a friend to send me weather forecasts via text as I request them but it would be easier if I could just text a number my location and it would shoot me back some basic forecast data. I guess the advantage of having a friend do it is I can always request more detailed information.

Weather.com apparently used to have a service back about eight years ago but it seems to be discontinued.  Surely such services still exists? I would have even thought the NOAA would offer such a service as it can be of critical safety concern in the back country.

On a side note has anyone been using the Motorola Defy Satellite Link?  I have seen some recent reviews and updates on Youtube now that it is out and their appears to be some earlier adopter issues but nothing that would stop me from buying it.  My reasons are as follows.

1) SOS / SARS (search and rescue)... you can even get insurance for jist a few dollars.
2) basic tracking so friends and family know where I am
3) ability to stay in contact via text in case of emergencies
4) getting weather forecasts on demand while off grid

277,1693015983.0,Backpacking again after back injury...thanks to this community.,"I've always loved being on trail and never thought too much about pack weight. After recovering from a spinal injury I just figured those days were over as there was no way I could tote a 'normal' pack on a 3 to 5 day hike.

Finding this sub and building out a pack has been such fun. Expensive but fun. I have just sponged so much from yall. My new pack is now so light and comfortable, compared to my old normal, it barely registers and there's very little pain in my lower back after sustained hours of hiking.

I was a bit nervous before my first trip because everything being so light it just seemed ""flimsy"".  My first long loop was mostly above 10,000 feet and the nights were cold. The sleep system was amazing. I never thought I'd be using a quilt. Never knew those existed. The first night in my 'flimsy' UL tent there was sleet that turned to hail and then wind and rain. That 'flimsy' looking zpack duplex (what, no poles) tent held up better than anything I've ever owned. The sleep system was comfortable and maybe a bit too warm? Is that a thing? Maybe I need more than one? This one is 0 degree.

Now I've been out a few times and it's just amazing. I just can't express the joy in words. The UL way, even though I'm not as hard-core as many of you, has been a game changer. Now I'm thinking a thru hike IS possible and that was never true even before the accident.

278,1693014957.0,Hybrid merino-synthetic sun hoody... does it exist?,"I've got a pretty fair complexion and practically live in sun hoodies. I've used several variations across quite a few brands (the mountain hardwear crater lake is my current favorite as it fits me really well), but all of them have been synthetic - mostly polyester/blends, occasionally nylon. Generally this is fine and I have no issues, but they do tend to stink if I'm out for extended periods - like more than 3-4 days at a time.

I've got an 8 day trip coming up, and started poking around looking at merino/merino blend sun hoodies in an attempt to mitigate the stench factor. I typically take a set of sleep clothes, but this would be the primary base layer that will get worn every day. 

I've found a few interesting options - but the more I searched, the more I wondered why I wasn't seeing a piece with synthetic material in high wear areas for durability, but with merino/merino blend panels in the high sweat zones. Ideally it would fit similar to the crater lake, and perhaps have a 1/4 zip closure at the neck for venting during high output efforts. Is anyone making something like this?

Not sure on exact denier or if the X grid is worth it.

Ultra 100/200 - Seems really good, better abrasion than dyneema, very lightweight. Newer fabric which might not be the best, also cannot print on it.

Liteskin LS07 - Very lightweight, waterproof, has good abrasion resistance unlike dyneema. Biggest thing is that I have seen very little about it online and the fact it isn't really used much to make backpacks makes me wary also can't print on it.

Ecopak EPX200 - Should hold up very well, it is waterproof. Biggest concern is the weight vs other options, I wish they offered EPLX for printing.

2.92oz DCH - Waterproof and very lightweight but bad abrasion resistance, seems to have the most delamination issues, and is the most expensive which especially matters if it doesn't last as long. The 50D face is the lowest out of anything here and while I'm almost always on trails I don't want to have to worry about a stray branch cutting my pack going under a fallen tree ripping something.

282,1692978471.0,What do you use as a water filter?,"My current choice is the Platypus Quickdraw along with its bag and some spare aquatabs in 1st aid kit. I like how I can check if it's compromised or not along with faster flow rate over the sawyer. I have been looking at going with a befree however. I like that it filters faster and would work better with soft flasks to just drink out of that easily while on the go. I am a little concerned about long term durability especially for a thru-hike since I've seen a lot of complaints about it clogging up.

Also curious to hear from those that use soft flasks on what they use, how they like them, and how they hold up.

I know some use aquatabs/aquamira/bleach as their primary method to save weight but I just couldn't. I know that there's weight difference beyond even just the filter itself since I'm more likely to be carrying around some extra water weight but it is just worth it to me.

285,1692935654.0,Looking for ideas on sleep systems for small packs,"I've been away from 'the game' for a pretty long time, closer to twenty years in fact, so I apologize if this is a more laughable left-field idea. I'm looking for ideas on how to get a nice, compact sleep system that can fit into a small 20-30L daypack. I'm only passingly familiar with ""ranger rolls"" but the idea seems to make sense: a burrito of pad / sleep-in-layer / cover. The US Army MSS's don't seem particularly small or light and I feel like the idea can be significantly improved on given the advances in backpacking gear. Shelter plan is a Durston x-mid. I was hoping to keep the sleep system's total footprint comparable to the x-mid's packed footprint, if that's even possible.

To be clear, I'm coming at this from ground zero. Virtually all of my old gear has been purged over the many years since using it and of what remains, much is unusable. My old mummy bag sucked so no interest in keeping that, the blow up Coleman sleeping pad was tossed long ago after the valve broke, etc.

Edit: more details since they became relevant to the suggestions. I'm planning primarily for myself and two gradeschool aged kids. Initial trips will be local in beautiful but humid, bitey-bug filled Florida.

286,1692924226.0,BRS-3000T vs MSR Pocket Rocket,"TL/DR — no significant difference in gas usage though BRS puts out less heat. Glad I bought the BRS!

I’ve had and used an MSR Pocket Rocket (85 grams) since the early Aughts and loved it for the weight. But as I’ve gotten older and wanting to trim grams for my knees’ sake, I picked up a BRS-3000T (26 grams) for about $18 via Amazon. 

I didn’t read many reviews because of the price - it was a really small price for me to pay for some experimentation. However, worried that the BRS may not be as efficient, I did indeed experiment.

I am at 50 feet above sea level (Sacramento Valley in California).

Gas — new 220 g Snow Peak can each stove

Pot — Snow Peak titanium 450 cup

Water — 12 ounces by weight at 79 F 

Temp — digital thermometer

Method — I weighed out the water and checked its temperature while in the titanium cup. Then screwed a stove onto a gas can and weighed the stove and gas combination. I weighed them together so that the lost weight was only due to the burn not due to loss when unscrewing the stove. Placed the cup with water on the stove and inserted the digital thermometer probe with the probe’s flange resting on the cup lip so the probe was in the same place for each stove’s burn. I opened the gas valve and lit the stove using an MSR piezo lighter. Then started a timer on my phone and adjusted the flame to an all blue flame and with as little gap between the flame and the burner surface as possible (i.e. the burn was gas/O2 efficient with little loss of unburned gas). That setting was not a wide open valve by any measure. The MSR valve was open about 1.25 turns. The BRS was open about 1 turn.

I took note of the water temp at 1 minute and also timed how long it took to raise the water temp to 180F. 

I used 12 oz water and 180F since that is what most of my meals are based on. I don’t bring water to a boil and I don’t cook meals but merely add hot water to dehydrated ingredients. Most recipes call for 1 1/2 cups of water per serving.

Results — The MSR at 1 minute temp was 122F. The BSR at 1 minute temp was 108F. The MSR took 2 minutes 34 seconds to raise the water to 180F. The BRS took 3 minutes 25 seconds. The MSR used 5 grams of gas. The BRS used 4 grams. Note, the scale only shows whole grams and rounds up so there is a margin-of-error of at least a half gram to as much as 0.9 grams for this measure.

Conclusion — though the BRS took a full minute longer to raise the 12 oz of water from 79F to 180F, it did not use a significantly lesser nor greater amount of gas. Both stoves could heat up 22 to 27 servings of these 12 ounce cups of water from a 110 gram net isobutane gas can.

I've taken these clothes comfortably down to about 50 but not sure if I'll need anything warmer since I don't spend a lot of time in camp.

I already wear pants and with my fleece I don't know if I'll need them but open to hearing from others. The only major change I might make is switching the Altaplex for an X-Mid Pro 1 for more headroom because I'm 6'1 and will hit the walls on the Altaplex so use my pack liner over the foot end of my quilt to help keep it dry. The Befree seems nice with how quick it is but afraid that it might clog which seems very common. I might switch my pillow to something a bit lighter but that's about it overall.

I will end up doing several trips before this and hopefully a final shakedown trip of sorts a week before.

The Report: 

Day 1 (9 Miles) 

The crew started hiking around 2pm on Friday. Thin, young forests took us to some wet crossings with nice meadows and MILES of muddy, boggy trail. Fishing along the way was terrific. About 3 miles in one party member spotted 2 bull Moose looking BIG and healthy. A terrific site. Rain was off and on and not heavy. We also scared away a small heard of elk before arriving at our campsite at Mile 8.8. If we would have gone just 5 more minutes up the trail to Mile 9.0 we would have had cleared the tree line for an amazing campsite but our little meadow and pond was more sheltered and got the job done. Some sprinkles in the evening made the 9.5x9.5 flat tarp a worthwhile item. Once the stoves were going and all the bodies were under, you could really feel the warmth and the comradery was terrific. I will definitely be bringing a flat tarp for any group trips with a wet forecast. We checked the Garmin weather for tomorrow and it wasn't looking good. We decided an early morning start.

Day 2 (16 Miles)

Another Garmin weather check and it was in our favor this time. Thunderstorms were not predicted until the afternoon which made our pass and ridge walk much less daunting. One hiker was feeling off with the altitude. More on that later. We were on trail just before 7am with a beautiful high basin walk above tree line as the sun began to light up the peaks around us. We tackled the pass and were rewarded with amazing panoramic views. Altitude was around 12,100ft. The ridgeline from the pass to Red Knob Pass is some of the best walking in all of the Uintas. Coming off of Red Knob we started to see many (maybe 8 to 10?) hikers on the UHT walking fast to tackle the passes before the weather came in. All in good spirits. That little thru hike is getting more popular. Walking was good along the basin down from Red Knob and we got back under the treeline.  A nice climb before lunch to a little alpine pond with soft grass along the banks was a nice stop. Again, just happy to have the sun out and comfortable laying out.  
  
Walking from here was terrific as we skirted the tree line with amazing views. Around Mile 21 clouds and winds were building and threatening weather. We set up a tarp and chilled for a bit. As the clouds darkened, we wanted to take the opportunity to stay at the treeline to see how the next 30 minutes would pass since it was forecasting nasty thunderstorms and we couldn't see much behind the tall ridgeline. It provided easier options for taking shelter among the trees if needed, but nothing happened. We pressed on. About 2 miles down the trail the wall of rain was more obvious this time making its way up the basin towards Porcupine Pass. We had enough time to set up the tarp in a storm mode and a couple others chose to do their tents. I feel bad for them because the group tarp was a certified vibe chamber and lots of laughs were had as we passed the time. Rain and wind was heavy but in about an hour it passed and the broken clouds gave us the confidence to press on toward the last pass of the day. The hiking up to no-name pass, 12,150' (I call it Red Castle Lake Pass) is a fun mini off-trail challenge. Nothing technical and many ways to get up. I like to stay on the trail to Porcupine Pass as long as possible before peeling off to avoid the marsh. Ascending up the drainage is easy and eventually becomes a steep game trail that mellows out to some faint switch backs before the grassy ledge. Once you gain the grassy ledge it is an easy ascent to the pass.  
  
That same hiker from earlier that morning experienced sickness on the climb up the pass. With help from other party members, they took their pack and everyone made it on top of the pass. Views from this pass of Upper Red Castle and Red Castle Lake were stellar. We descended with no technical difficulty to our campsite at Upper RC Lake (11,600ft). The fish were jumping and several of the tenkara rods caught BIG tiger trout. Just about any dry or wet fly works up there. It was hard to stop to pull yourself away to eat dinner. Again, just happy it wasn't raining. A bit later, the same hiker was still feeling quite ill and threw up many times. This worried everyone and we used a Zoleo to contact medical assistance as well as a friend to get more information on altitude sickness and exhaustion and what steps to take. I do really appreciate these devices and never go out  into the backcountry without them. The group did go into a problem solving mode. The trail ahead does not descend much at all and had slow, technical off-trail hiking for a mile before reaching the established trail. This was all happening around 7pm and light was already dwindling fast. All information from the medical professionals said to stay put and get rest. Monitor the hiker and if they get worse then immediately get down min. 1,600ft. The hiker was stable with no signs of her getting worse so we stayed at camp. Wind throughout the night flapped any loose panels. That combined with the worry of our friend made for a very light toss and turn ""sleep."" Overall, epic day.  


Day 3 (12 Miles)

A beautiful morning hop down mini cliffs, grassy slopes, talus fields and boulder fields got us back to the established trail descending away from RC Lake. Trail was cruiser with some muddy trail around Lower RC Lake. We reconvened at the bridge at a trail junction about 8mi from the trailhead. Two party members (including the sick hiker) decided to head down the easy, but beautiful, trail to China Meadows TH while the rest of the party continued on the original route to Bald Mt. The trail leading up to bald mountain is faint and quiet. It is a little rocky and climbs steadily to a nice stream and meadow. We took a break here before our ascent. There are a few different routes you can take and I've always chosen the more direct route. Trail fades in and out and is steep but eventually turns to switchbacks. You're at the top before you know it and the open landscape grassy hiking to Bald Mountain is some of my favorite of the whole trail. It adds a nice variety of views to the 37mi and is a nice little cherry on top before descending to the car.   
  
The trail down from Bald Mountain is pretty rocky and once you hit the switchbacks it is obvious the horses really churn up the rocks and dirt so hiking here is probably the worst of the entire trip in that it is boring and requires your attention to not roll an ankle. Before long, (about 2.5mi) you make the hard left turn towards the bridge. Here you have boring forests but a flat trail before hitting the bridge. No tripping hazards makes for a good time to keep your head up while walking for once and reflect on a couple poor gear choices you made. A nice sit at the bridge, maybe one last cast of the tenkara rod, is a good way to end it. Bathrooms at the TH and just don't do what I did and forget a cooler full of snacks and drinks.

Thoughts: just like all the High Uinta hikes, this trail is a slow burn. It does not look that hard on Gaia/Caltopo but it low key packs a punch. Muddy, rocky, faint, sun-exposed trail all above 10k feet can take a toll. This loop is my absolute favorite I have done in this range and I love it dearly. It is my third time being up on this specific part of the uintas over about 10+ trips I've made to this range. It is a MUST DO for weekend backpackers. Just come prepared for high altitude and exposed hiking.  
  
Gear Notes: Dursten Xmid Pro 2, I needed to guy one corner to prevent some flapping but was too lazy to get up. The Nashy Cutaway is the best pack. Get one! We had three on this trip. New to me was this Gore Wear R7 shakedry jacket. It was awesome. Crazy how well it works in the rain and its very nice next to the skin while hiking because it breaths so well. Durability is the issue but seemed solid on this first trip. Tenkara has been the best backpacking activity for many of us. It is just such a thrill catching a fish and really breaks up the day and it's so light. Nunatak Sastrugis have been great for me and my wife. There were other cozy zipperless, hoodless bags on this trip. 

Since there is so much open, exposed terrain here I recommend a silpoly mid or tarp that can be quickly deployed and can handle the wind, hail, and rain. ",Ultralight

If you use a curved needle, you can pretty easily run the thread deep into the shoes' midsole, so it doesn't come out. The replacements they sent me ended up blowing out in the exact same way at around 300 miles. I sewed them up and have put another 400 miles on them without the hole getting any worse.

298,1692797165.0,Thermarest Corus 20 vs Sierra Design Nitro 800 20,"Hi all,


I’m uk based and need a new sleeping bag/quilt for this weekend so have to order from someone who can do next day delivery. 


As it’s getting into autumn here I would like something that can comfortably handle temperatures up to mid December (maybe wearing more layers underneath)


I’m looking at getting something light with a max budget of around £200. This has so far whittled my choices down to these two quilts. I just cannot decide which to get.



The Corus has 525g of 650 Fil and 20D nylon. 772g. This is slightly cheaper.


The sierra design is 420g of 800 fil and 15D nylon. 760g. 


The sierra looks like it has better baffle construction and is wider than the corus. I don’t think the SD foot box would fit a sleeping pad. I think I could probably improvise a system to attach a strap to the SD so I could attach it more securely to the sleeping pad.


The Corus looks fairly narrow and the no one seems to use the top strap anyway. My main concern is that the fil power and amount of down doesn’t seem as impressive as the SD. I do like that I could fit my pad in it if required though.


I’ve been looking at sleeping quilts for far too long so if anyone could advise me on what is the better choice here, or if there are others I should consider, I would be grateful.


NB I can’t get a cumulus due to lead time.


Edit: The SD nitro 800 20 just arrived and I am genuinely very pleased with it. The baffles and how it helps distribute down looks far better than what I’ve seen in videos of the Corus. It is really nicely wide and can fully wrap around me to form basically a mummy sleeping bag if I really want. There are some patches allowing light through when I hold it up to the light but a bit of a shake and these disappear without down shutting around in other places.

304,1692722884.0,Has anyone noticed the Ursack use directions can't (and shouldn't) be followed/,"/ they're really, really stupid directions

[https://ursack.com/pages/how-to-use](https://ursack.com/pages/how-to-use)

>Step 1: TIE CORD IN A KNOT Tie the cord with a double overhand knot-tight-so that there is no opening at the top of the bag. If food is visible, you have packed too much in. Ifyou can see it, a bear can get it.

A double overhand is the wrong knot, all it does is make it harder to untie if an animal tries to pull on the extra cord.  What would work better is after pulling closed is to tie a clove hitch tight around the bag below the cinch point.  You can adjust it easily so there's no slack between it and the opening.  This knot cinches down really easy and tightens the opening even more.   It's taught to ten-year-olds so it's easy to get right.   Then wrap again more time and tie a square knot .  Wrap again and tie another.  Keep wrapping until there's no extra cord.  The square knots keep the clove hitch from going loose.  This idea on the square knots, if not necessarily this knot.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=n-DtbFTd-7M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=n-DtbFTd-7M)

>Step 2: KEEP AWAY FROM CAMP Ursack must be secured to a fixed object that is a safe distance from our camp site. If using more than one Ursack, separate them at least 25 yards. No trees? Try hiding your Ursack under a pile of rocks. If you are using an OPSak and have been keeping food smells off the outside, it is unlikely a bear can find a well hidden Ursack.

No mention of LNT, just make up your own distance?  And tell people to move rocks.  NO, DON'T MOVE ROCKS!  Leave No Trace Principals say ""Leave rocks, plants, and other natural objects as you find them.""  You should never go hunting for enough rocks to make a pile a bear can't push out of the way. It's never a practice to undertake.  If you find a pile of rocks you should scatter it to return the campsite to a more natural appearance.  Or build a better fire ring if a fire spot needs improving. Leave the place better than you found it.

LNT has issues with bear hangs and going out of the campsite to place a canister in general ""Keep campsites small. Focus activity in areas where vegetation is absent.""  But it's easier to avoid vegetation in terms of impact than moving dozens upon dozens of rocks around from all over.

step 3:

>TIE UP TO A STRONG BRANCH Tie Ursack to a tree branch using a figure 8 or another knot that resists clinching, so that it can be untied easily. Alternatively, tie a secure knot and then counterbalance over a high (10' +) tree branch-not a guarantee, but it will thwart some bears.

There's just a slight problem, you would NEVER be able to tie to anything to a tree using a Figure 8.

A figure 8 knot is a stop knot.  You use it when putting a rope through a grommet.  They meant a clove hitch for sure and just didn't care to check their work.    [https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/figure-8-knot)

Also notice you have two options.  Tie with a defined (but wrong knot) and put it on ""a tree branch"" of undefined size and location.

Or counterbalance 10 feet up using an undefined method.  You need to bring extra cord to do so.  And you need \*two\* bags to counterbalance so something else needs to go in the air of similar weight.   For directions they sure assume you can figure that out.

Wait, counterbalancing works sometimes but most of the time a bear gets into my food?  Yeah, let me get right on that method.  I really wanted a recommendation that they already know mostly doesn't work.

So at this point all three methods to secure are badly written.  These directions are just bad.  Top to bottom they need to be rewritten for clarity and use correct methods.

I looked deeply at getting an Ursack.  It could have been a good product but the flaws in how they present their product doesn't lend confidence.  I got a bear vault in the end.  To use it I screw the lid on properly walk 100 feet away, put it down and walk away.

Ursack needs new directions with that level of simplicity and clarity.",Ultralight

314,1692636836.0,First backpacking tent decision BA Copper Ul 2 vs Nemo dagger Osmo 2,"Hello all, 

As the title hints at I need help or advice on deciding which tent to go with as my first real backpacking tent. I’ve done a fair bit of research and narrowed down my decision between two choices. The Big Agnes copper UL 2 and the NEMO dagger Osmo 2. Both seem to have features that I like and dislike about them and I’m having a hard time making my final decision. 

Starting out with what I like about the Big Agnes.
Pros.
 Lighter weight, the canopy feature, larger pockets on the inside to keep things off the floor
Color coded poles making for an easier set up. 
 Cons.
 It overall looks more brittle and less durable. I’ve read plenty of comments about the zippers being hard to work (which concerns me the most) affecting longevity of the product and there’s nothing more frustration than having to mess with bad zippers in the middle of the night when you’re trying to pee.

 Also I’m concerned about how well it actually fits 2 people, I plan to use it by myself and occasionally with my girlfriend. We will both be using sleeping pads and wondering how is the livability with 2 people and 2 packs (the large pockets on the inside seem to help with this. 

For the Nemo,
Pros.
I like that it seems better at fitting 2 people without having to upgrade to a 3 person tent which would greatly increase the weight.
I like that it overall seems to be more durable and less see through.
I also like the outside footprint where you can put your boots or packs.
Cons.
I dislike the amount of pockets it has on the inside and there size.
It also is a higher weight which I’m assuming has to do with the thicker material so not too big of a deal if that means better longevity. It looks less breathable with the rain fly on.
The size is also larger packed up taking up more room in the pack. I plan on using this as a solo tent also so I need this to fit with everything else.

So overall what are your guys opinions on both products. I’d prefer answers from people who have used them long term and possibly have used them both which would be great !

Edit* I will be buying a footpad for either choice

315,1692633471.0,Screws as UL emergency snow traction?,"Edit: Thanks, all.  Learned through your responses and my follow-up that Frog Toggs sells, $7 on Amazon, sets of 30 screw-in studs designed for fly fishing.  From shipping weight I estimate 7g per stud. Unlike Orvis, standard head so installation tooling should add little or no weight. Have ordered.  Doesn’t preclude a more advanced traction device or technique but certainly better than my screwy idea (pun intended), so I figured I’d add that to my toolbox. 

—-

For a multi-day backpack where/when snow accumulation/ice is possible but rather unlikely. I’m thinking of carrying eight 3/4” flathead wood screws (0.5 oz total) instead of heavier crampons or micro spikes. If necessary (freak storm) I could screw them out through the sole, then reinsert footbed above them.  Tested on an old worn shoe and seems feasible. Carrying regardless a multi tool that includes a screwdriver, and trekking poles. 

I don’t know whether this is a good idea, foolhardy, or pointless weight.  But strikes me as according with UL principles of substituting on-trail as-needed labor for weight and covering serious contingencies while not overpacking.   Inspired by reading here of an Alaskan who inserted such screws seasonally. 

Immediate context here is a mid-Sept backpack in Colorado, Indian Peaks Wilderness, at elevations of 9k to 12k or more.  Last winter’s snowpack won’t be an issue but there is a small-but-material chance of significant early snow (that is, scanning 10 years’ past NWS records for the same month at the closest nearby high-elevation station, 9k’, I see there were a few dustings and one 7” blizzard).

I love the tent and it worked perfectly however 2 small things:

1. I am about 190cm / 6 feet 3 inches and I always touch the inner net in one way or the other while sleeping. Didn't really bother me but I would like to see if I there are better options
2. I don't use trekking poles for hiking. I carried one for the tent but never used it except for setting up the tent

If I weight the **tent + stakes + trekking pole** it's about **1.2kg / 2.6lb.**

I could get the weight down with a dedicated **carbon fiber tent pole** and would be at **1.039kg / 2.29lb**

Without stakes it's **905g / 1.99lb**

So looking only at the weight if I went with a freestanding tent it would have to be somewhere around this weight or less. However that's not the only thing to consider of course and I am wondering..

* Are trekking pole tents generally faster to set up than freestanding ones? At camp I felt like I was always quite a bit faster with setting up than everyone else and it also looked quite fiddly seeing others setting up. I got used to the quick and simple pitch of the lanshan and feel comfortable with it. Sure I would get used to setting up any tent over time but could it be worth to just get a carbon tent pole and another trekking pole tent?
* There don't seem to be that many options for trekking pole tents in europe and a lot of them use 2 poles. Fine if you use trekking poles but again I just feel like it's kind of wasted going with a trekking pole tent if you don't also use them for hiking. Also space wise there probably wont be any tents that set up with only 1 pole and are fine for taller people?

Maybe people from europe (that are tall) what tent are you using? The most appealing one to me right now is the Bonfus Solus 1P (475g/16.7oz) which even with 2 tent poles would be almost 500g/1.1lb lighter than my current shelter

320,1692567884.0,Lightest possible hydration systems with NO plastic???,"I generally like to avoid using plastic but especially I like to avoid eating/drinking things from plastic, so I've been toying around with the idea of switching to a plastic-free hydration system. Does anyone have any experience with this and, if so, what have you used? I'm pretty sure this is going to require a weight increase but I'd like to make the increase as little as possible.

The closest analog I've found to a Smart Water bottle would be something like [Open Water](https://drinkopenwater.com/products/still-water-electrolytes). We bought some of these at an airport before a trip that included hiking near Las Vegas and ended up refilling it repeatedly for the entire trip. The aluminum certainly doesn't have the durability of a smart water bottle; by the end of the week, we banged up one of them enough that it started leaking. Open water's largest size is only 16 oz / 0.47 liters, so that's not superb either. ([Alibaba seems to have lots of options for aluminum soft drink bottles](https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/soft-drink-aluminum-bottle.html), including some up to 1 liter, but I'm not planning on ordering 100s or 1000s of them.)

For more durability and size, my initial searching seems to be leading to titanium, although that would come at a big weight cost. [This Silverant bottle](https://silverantoutdoors.com/products/extra-large-titanium-water-bottle-1500ml?variant=42056073183410), for example, weighs 250g but holds 52.8 ounces / 1.5L (6 ml/g). I've already got a [Boundless Voyage Canteen Mess Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Boundless-Voyage-Camouflage-Kidney-Shaped-Ti15158Br/dp/B08PBGLL7T/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=titanium%2Bcanteen&qid=1692566823&sr=8-3&th=1), and the bottle weighs 162g and holds 1.1L (6.8 ml/g), so perhaps adding more titanium canteens like that one for when I need the additional carrying capacity?

322,1692525918.0,Finished my first backpacking trip on the Tour du Mont Blanc,"Alright I have the urge to say thank you to this community for helping me with all my questions I had there really are some awesome people here. Originally I wanted to hike the TMB from hut to hut but then decided to backpack it. I never used a tent before so I had no idea about all the gear and spent quite a lot of time watching videos, reading articles and asking and finally got everything ready and started the trip

This was my gear: [https://lighterpack.com/r/b2dfvh](https://lighterpack.com/r/b2dfvh) (**WARNING:** not ultralight (yet))

I am sorry I'm too lazy right now to change all the single items from grams to oz/lb but overall weight is in lb

So I don't think it's worth to break down all my single days since there are tons of information about this trip online and I more or less followed the main route anyway but I would like to write a bit about my experiences about backpacking for the first time and also the gear

Just as a summary the numbers:

* 250 km, + 11.458m, - 12.220m or
* 155 mi, + 37.592 ft, - 40.092 ft

I have to confess that I did not do any overnights before the trip. I did set everything up a few times until I felt somewhat comfortable and also hiked a few km with all the gear but that was it.

And the first night immediately was a rough test. It rained the entire time and also through the night. I arrived at the spot where I wanted to camp it was marked as a bivouac place on the map. Couldn't find a flat spot so I had to set up on a hilly ground on a slope while it was raining the entire time which was quite rough. I wasn't able to pitch perfectly but it worked out and inside of the tent didn't get wet. Also nothing leaked during the night

Didn't sleep alot since I set up in a way that I always rolled down from the sleeping pad (learned my lesson now) but got a huge confident boost the next day. Also didn't rain at all the rest of the trip

After a few days of setting everything up and packing everything I got quite comfortable with it. I knew in which order to do everything and how to pack and unpack and where to put certain items etc.

As on my last hike last year (Alta Via 1 from hut to hut) meeting other people on trail was again the highlight of the trip. Sitting together at camp while everyone cooks their food and talks about all kinds of stuff is such a pure and raw experience that just sticks with you way more than nice views. Made new friends that I hope to meet again in the future. Hopefully next year already

I will definitely continue backpacking and am currently going through my gear to improve it. Some thoughts about the gear I used:

**Lanshan 1 (2021)**

I am surprised how good this tent is. Originally I was ready to spend like 500€ on a tent since I though that's like the most important piece where you shouldn't try to save money on. So I was hesitant to go with a 100€ tent from aliexpress but I had zero issues. It didn't leak, it is light and fast to pitch. Also I think it looks cool. However I think I will replace it after a few more trips because:

1. I am roughly 190cm / 6 feet 3 inches and while I can sleep in it quite comfortably I do touch the inner net. It's not too bad but I will see if there are better options for taller people
2. I don't use trekking poles. I bought a pair because literally everyone recommended them for the TMB and I did want to use them but ended up not (as like the only person on the TMB). I  brought 1 because I had to for the tent however I will either ditch it and get a tent pole which is a lot lighter or maybe I will go with a freestanding tent which seems to make more sense

**Hyberg Attila X 50L**

Great 700g backpack made of XPac. I was a bit worried since my baseweight is quite high due to camera gear and with food I was just under the recommended weight limit (which is 15kg / 33lb) but I still found it comfortable to carry. Also got a lot of questions about it. However I think after going through my gear I might get away with a smaller one. Still this is a great backpack and would use it again

**Sleeping System**

NeoAir XLite NXT + Liteway 850 Down Quilt. I love this. Have the rectangular RW version and that is just about perfect in terms of sizing for me. Zero complaints here. Was warm every night eventhough had to put on my down jacked 2 times (was close to freezing though)

**Clothes**

Very happy with my clothes overall. Really love the Arcteryx Cormac Sunhoody and the Patagonia Strider Pro 5 and will stick to them as my hiking outfit. Also the Patagonia Terrebone Joggers are awesome. Used them for pretty much everything.

**Items to remove/change**

* I will remove the tripod (1,01kg / 2,2lb). I didn't use it once so it was just an additional 2.2lb for nothing
* I was extremely happy with the cheap decathlon rainjacket. Rained the entire first day and it kept me dry. However its almost 500g / 1.1lb) so I will look for something different. Have their raincut which is like half the weight  and exactly the same material but I was happy that I brought the jacket instead and had pockets etc.
* Tent / Trekking Pole. As said above will probably look for other options after a few more trips
* Merino Leggings: Planned to sleep in merino longsleeve + leggings but ended up using the leggings maybe once. Slept either in boxer briefs or the joggers + longsleeve. So will remove the leggings
* Camera Filters: Will most likely remove all or just bring 1 (instead of 4)

&#x200B;

**Items to add**

* Thinking about adding some slippers for camp. Saw a few people with them and it would feel awesome having something different for camp just to get out of your shoes
* Soap: I didn't bring soap either for myself or for clothes which was fine but I think it would be nice to have something. I handwashed clothes or myself with water only. Sometimes there was something available on campsite but I think I will look into options

**Food**

I brought too much for this trip (think 2.5kg overall). I brought

* 3x freeze dried
* 6x own packaged couscous with spices + dried vegetables
* 6x own packaged oats + nuts
* 15x packs of coffee (2g each)
* 8x bars (mostly cliff bars, think about 70g each)
* 2L water

Ended up with 1 freeze dried meal and a few oat packages. Ate baguette/salami a lot also enough grocery stores etc. to buy things. I prefer my own couscous over freeze dried eventhough the freeze dried meals were very nice (Firepot). I like cold soaking but I also love my coffee so I will bring stove etc. anyway.

Was originally going with the Copper Spur HV UL3 before I read that it was a tight squeeze for 3.

Would love to hear other 4 person tent suggestions and experiences people have had with the Tarptent Hogback.~~

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. My main thought behind my posting it here to the ultralight sub is that I wanted to be the pack mule for the family and carry all the essentials in one bag, but yall have brought up the possibility of being split up and only having one tent for everyone. With that being considered, Im definitely leaning more towards tarps now, and most likely two, one for my pack and one for my wifes (2 10'x10').

On the topic of tarps, I live in TX and our bugs tend to eat me alive the minute it starts getting humid. As this is mostly for a SHTF application, a degree of ""suck it up buttercup"" is to be expected. But are there bug nets big enough for a 10'x10' tarp?",Ultralight

**Short overview**:

*Gear overview in the bottom*

Day 1 - 30 km / 18.5 mi - Kauksi-Agusalu. I started off from Kauksi and went straight to the beach of Lake Peipus. After a nice beachwalk I met two other hikers who would be the only ones I'd meet in a while. Then the trail turned to gravel roads which I walked until I reached Agusalu campsite.

  
Day 2 - 50 km / 31 mi - Agusalu-Jõuga. The morning started off with gravel roads again until I reached Kotka hiking trail which was quite nice. After this I continued on small roads to Jõuga campsite which was popular with locals having a party there.

  
Day 3 - 47 km / 29 mi - Jõuga-Vaivara. This day had one of the nicest trails yet near beautiful Kurtna lakes. It's a nice short loop trail to do if not doing the complete 614 km. When I got out of the forest and next to the railway it started pouring rain. I passed Viivikonna ghost town and slept next to a field.

  
Day 4 - 41 km / 25.5 mi - Vaivara-Toila. The weather was rainy when I got to Sinimäe which was an important place for Estonia in WW2. From the observation tower I could see the Baltic Sea and soon I was on the coast. I passed Sillamäe and was on top of the cliff's edge when a storm hit. Luckily it calmed down soon enough.

  
Day 5 - 46 km / 28.5 mi - Toila-Aidu-Liiva. This day was the most physically hard one yet as I had to hike an impassable coast. You could either climb in muddy clay, climb over hundreds of fallen trees or walk in the sea. I was glad when it was over. But the evening brought Aidu quarry with its steep hills to cross.

  
Day 6 - 65 km / 40 mi - Aidu-Liiva-Punasoo. It was my longest day ever mostly thanks to a lot of roadwalking. However I finally made it out of Ida-Viru county on day 6. I encountered tons of ticks and some deer flies on one section but I managed to keep going.

  
Day 7 - 53 km / 33 mi - Punasoo-Mardihansu. This day was the mental low point. I had many worries but luckily some of them were relieved when I found a power outlet. Today had a lot of small forest roads, old nuclear warhead storage facilities and little to no blazes.

  
Day 8 - 49 km / 30.5 mi - Mardihansu-Lehtse. I took it much slower today and it meant my morale was higher. There were quite a bit of actual trail today and a long stretch of nice soft forest road. Stealth camped in Lehtse town.

  
Day 9 - 53 km / 33 mi - Lehtse-Paunküla town. Hiked to Aegviidu where I stopped at RMK visitor center to dry up and recharge. The weather was nice but my foot started to cause me extreme pain and had some swelling. 

  
Day 10 - 10 km / 6 mi - Paunküla and a sick day. The pain hadn't gone down so I got off trail, saw a doctor and rested.

  
Day 11 - 0 km / 0 mi - sick day. I took the prescribed meds and the swelling and pain had gone down. Packed my bag to hike on next morning. 

  
Day 12 - 40 km / 25 mi - Paunküla town-Järlepa. Hiked on and everything was going nicely until a thunderstorm arrived. I walked in heavy rain and was a bit worried at one point. Reaching Järlepa campsite I actually made a fire there to warm myself a bit.

  
Day 13 - 56 km / 35 mi - Järlepa-Varbola. After Kohila the trail was amazing. A super long stretch of forest trail and then an old trail in the bog. When it turned towards the swamp and hayfields though I had to get my GPS because there was no trail. Leg had swollen up again and it was worse this time.

  
Day 14 - 46 km / 28.5 mi - Varbola-Hirvepargi. Passed through Märjamaa town and bought some meds which helped my leg. Had the most boring road walk ever on an old rail to road section.

  
Day 15 - 40 km / 25 mi - Hirvepargi-Penijõe. A great amount of roadwalking next to Matsalu National Park where nothing really happened. The weather was hot and I was glad to finish the trail at last.

**Gear overview** copied from the blog post:

Good items: The main thing I was happy about was my Nashville Cutaway backpack. It was just amazing to hike with and the vest straps were comfortable even when carrying 2.5 L of water and 2.5 kg of food in addition to my baseweight. That would be 3 kg still under the upper limit of the bag. It was simple to get things from the bag using the small pockets on the straps and the big unipocket on the back.  
The other thing that saved me when walking on long gravel roads were Dirty Girls gaiters. These kept most of the small pebbles out of my shoe and let me keep on walking. The only thing I didn’t like was when the velcro started to peel off my shoe and I had to glue it back again two times.  
A thing that I was really happy about were my XERO Mesa Trail trail runners. I got no blisters from them, they dried relatively quickly and were comfortable for the full length of the trail. I’m also surprised by their durability as I’ve done over 1300 km / 800 mi with the same pair and only in the end did the upper mesh start to show signs of wear. I bet I can get few hundred kilometers more out of them.  
Lastly it’s quite important to have a headnet when walking in Estonia during summertime. Only this meant I finished my hike when I was attacked by mosquito or horseflie clouds. I used the Sea To Summit Nano as its cheap, easy to use and perfect for my needs.  
Okay items: Most other things I brought I can be happy with as well. My tarp and bivy worked great though I do need to check their connections. My MYOGed quilt was a bit small and I’d like to sew a new one but it did keep me warm at such a light weight. Electronics worked nicely and the hygiene and first aid kits were just what I needed. The only thing I’ll change is I’m going to bring more painkillers and also antihistamine. Surprisingly I was happy with Montbell Versalite rain jacket. It kept me mostly dry and only the hood was a bit wet on the inside.  
Gear failures: The two things that failed were a turkey oven bag as a pack liner and my Katadyn Befree filter. I had used the liner for few hundred kilometers already and it failed on me in the middle of the trip. I’ll just stick to Nylofume going forward. Regarding the water filter I discovered mine was compromised when I started the hike and I ordered a new one to Kiviõli. However that was defective. So I stayed away from filtering as much as possible which meant I had to carry around 2 more liters than I would’ve needed. I think I’ll try the Platypus Quickdraw next instead.

325,1692450296.0,Cumulus X-lite 300 (or similar PhD) Qs about zip length/size,"  
I am racing the Spine Challenger (south) in England next winter and looking for a lighter bag to my old Alpkit pipedream 400. This race attracts lots of gear questions because of the challenging conditions (rain, snow, wind, dark) but I see lots of conflicting reports on sleeping bags. I don't plan to sleep on the course outside, but I don't want to compromise safety and I am looking for something that provides additional warmth that may allow me to sleep a little even if unplanned.  
Requirements are:

>  
Sleeping bag with Hood “Comfort Limit” or “Lower Limit” or “Transition” Rating of 0C or colder.

&#x200B;

The recommended bag without budget constraints would be a PHD M.Degree 250 K Down . It is quite expensive and although I could afford it I doubt I will make much use of it. I don't have time for backpacking trips, but may need to have a bag for other races. I might fastpack the GR20 in corsica in a few years.  
I've been going backwards and forwards over different bags but the Cumulus X-lite 300 seems to hit the spot in terms of weight, materials, and cost. I know the Western Mountaineering bags are likely more functional but also more expensive and heavier. Since the bag wont be heavily used then I can compromise quality for weight . But is there another bag I should consider (I've looked at ThermaRest Hyperion 32F/0C , SeaSummit Spark Ultralight 28°F etc. but the Cumulus seems better ?  
Then I have lots of questions about customisations, especially zips. The lightest bags don’t come with a zip. The bag comes with 2/3rd length 3mm, but I also see lots of people saying the 3mm zip is bad and gets caught a lot. The 5mm zip then adds weight. I could go for a 1/3rd 5mm zip, but then that is probably not worth it as it won’t allow sufficient flexibility. Of course I can get the 3mm and just not use it so the functionality is not much worse than the no-zip bags.  
Default bag weight with 2/3rd 3mm = 465g  
No zip = 442 g  
5mm 2/3rd zip = 485g  
5mm 1/3rd zip = 471g  
How many ultralight people go without a zip entirely? I am guess the ability to open up is quite valuable . So maybe I am best just keeping with the default to save weight and money but give some flexibility in future use cases?

330,1692337987.0,shakedown request: timberline trail hike 42 mile 4 day hike,"I am still relatively new to backpacking been doing it on and off for a year or two but this spring and summer I took a deep dive into it. I had already been interested in in ultralight. before spring I began investing in some lighter equipment for my trips this summer. My base weight is under 10lbs already and I am just looking for any advice for the trip as this will be the first time I use some of my gear. 

Temperature, location and terrain
For the timberline trail I expect the lowest temperature at night to be in the high 40's and the highest day time temperature to be in the high 80's.the timberline trail is near Portland Oregon and is a circumnavigation of Mt.Hood. The area around Mt.hood is predominantly rocky with some sections of sand and tree cover. there are also a multitude of river crossings fed by the melting glacier. The rivers will not be dangerously high as I am hiking in late august after most of the snow has melted. but there are still two major river crossings spanning around 40ft across and up to knee hight. I am considering bringing sandals for the rivers because of how big they are.
I have not decided on whether to go clockwise or counter clockwise, I have heard of benefits to both but am open to advice from people who have completed the trail before.

Additional information
I'll be backpacking with one other person and will divide shared gear like the tent, cook kit, med kit, and trowel. the dry bag I am bringing for little things is  nonnegotiable as I need it to keep my meds safe and secures well as for electronics. we may be getting a battery bank but we were too late to be able to get one from 
Nitecore. The bowl is also not optional as some meals me and my partner are separating for meals. Though we are not able to make expensive changes to our gear we are going to make a stop beforehand so we may be able to make some minor gear changes. I do have a lighter backpack available to me but it does not fit well and chaffed my shoulders on every trip I used it on.

332,1692310756.0,Should body composition be part of the UL mindset?,"I got into a discussion with another user on this sub about this and would like to hear other peoples thoughts. I was saying as a community focused on carrying the least amount of weight possible with the goal of moving more efficiently, should we not also consider our body compositions? He/she disagreed suggesting it would be toxic.

I want to clarify my point by saying there shouldn’t be a goal body fat percent like there is for pack weight, everyone has their own body type and certain body fat percentages will be easier for some than others to achieve. But wouldn’t it be a healthy topic to make part of the conversation somehow? There will probably be people out there cutting off the end of their tooth brush and spending hundreds or even thousands on UL gear without even giving their body composition a second thought, because it’s not part of the ‘UL mindset’, when it could actually make a much bigger difference. Also, I’m sure there are people in this sub who are already on a weight loss journey in an aim to making hiking easier who would love the support of this community. As a community could we not somehow make body composition part of the mindset in a positive and helpful way? Or is it wrong, as a community, to consider body fat in the context of carrying less to move more efficiently? Or are we just a gear community? Or is the subject just too touchy to even mention and would lead to toxicity?

333,1692305445.0,I yeast-tested by Sawyer Squeeze out of paranoia. Did I do it right?,"Wanted to test my Sawyer Squeeze though I don't really have a reason to be afraid, just haven't used it in a bit. I know people say ""better safe than sorry"" but as parents say, I'm not made out of money!

So, inspired by u/liveslight and his post here, I tried a similar test: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/fcng4s/comment/fjccvtb/?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/fcng4s/comment/fjccvtb/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

>Grow up some yeast and filter it. Yeast cells are about the same size as some protozoa. You might test before and after filtering by seeing if more yeast grows by looking at bubble formation in a sugar water solution. See ""yeast co2 generator.""

Here's what I did:

took a package of active dry yeast (for bread) and combined it with some warm water until the water was cloudy and yeast fully dissolved,

I put half of the solution through the Sawyer Squeeze. It came out clear.

I tasted the clear water. It still tasted yeasty, but drinkable. The cloudy yeast water tasted far worse.

I took some flat soda and added it to the cup of clear filtered water and the cloudy yeast water.

No bubbles appeared in the clear filtered water. 

The cloudy yeast water started to clump in the middle of the cup, and showed bubbles.

Did I do it right?

I had some doubts because the filtered water didn't taste great, but this thread reassured me a bit:

Based on some recent trip reports I've read on AllTrails it sounds like bugs won't be an issue. So as much as I would love to get some real use out of my new X-Mid I may consider switching it out for my Borah tarp + bivy. Although that would also depend on how the weather is looking as I get closer, if there's significant chance of rain in the forecast I'll stick with the X-Mid. Along those lines, if bugs + weather are looking good another idea I had was to bring my 2-person Borah tarp for both my buddy and I to share, which would also drop his pack weight by \~2lbs (TT Double Rainbow).

335,1692295785.0,Toaks Pot Issue / Toaks Pot Alternative?,"Recently decided to ditch my Jetboil and get a Toaks Titanium Pot and Soto Windmaster stove, which is great, however I've noticed on the pot the handles get waaay too hot. I can't handle the pot while it's on the stove or for a few mins after. Just boiling water this isn't too big a deal but I also like to cook pasta and noodles which will be even harder as it'll be even hotter from being on the stove for longer.

I've seen online people have put silicone on the handles to stop this which looks good but I can't see what diameter tubing I'd want for the toaks pot and I dont want to have to order a load at once to find out. *Can anyone tell me what diameter tubing I'd need if anyone happens to have a toaks pot and done the same. (mm if possible, UK person here)*

Alternatively I'd potentially be looking at replacing the toaks pot for a Soto New River pot or Soto Thermostack cook set (both only slightly heavier but mitigate my hot handle issue)

If anyone has either of these, are they good? or can anyone recommend a different solution / pot?

336,1692293949.0,Trip Report: Uinta Highline Trail,"**Where:** Uinta Mountains, Northeastern Utah  
**When:** 8/8/23-8/11/23  
**Distance:** 92 miles, 15.6K vertical gain, Westbound  
**Conditions:** Fantastic. Mostly sunny with clouds popping up in the afternoon for welcome shade. Only on the first day did it threaten to rain but only ended up with a light sprinkle.  
**Useful Pre-Trip Information:** I was lucky and able to get a ride from a guy on the Uinta wilderness lovers FB group  
**Photo Album:** \[Digital Photos\](https://imgur.com/a/cgpm75p)

  
**Day 1:** 15 miles, 2K vertical gain. It was a long shuttle to the start at  Leidy Peak so the hike didn’t start until close to 2pm. The section was gorgeous as was the rest of the trail but the elevation still kept me slow. I was surprised that the path was less of a trail and more of the hint of a trail. E.g. follow the disturbed grass. The areas around lakes were quite boggy so I was always happy to be higher up. Ended up stopping on the west side of Chepeta Lake. Being low and near water made for the coldest night I would have on trail. Nothing bad just cool.

  
**Day 2:** 23.4 miles, 3.6K vertical gain. The first few miles from camp were below treeline before starting the approach to North Pole Pass. Still unacclimated, this easy pass took me a lot longer than anticipated but I did stop to talk to two other hikers on the way up. The weather was great and that was the only pass of the day. There were various stream crossings but all had rock hops or dry logs available. It was a rather short day taking one of the last sheltered sites before Anderson Pass in Painter’s Basin. The area is beautiful but it was one of the few places on the trail where bugs were an issue.

  
**Day 3:** 26.9 miles, 5.5K vertical gain. Started early at 5:45 to enjoy the dawn light as I made my way up Anderson Pass and moved slowly as I took a lot of photos on the way up. The pass itself wasn’t that bad and I was getting used to the elevation. I dropped my pack at the top of the pass and did the scramble up to King’s Peak. It was just steep enough to induce my slight fear of heights but I got used to it. I was also worried about my ankles on the scramble (if you wear Hokas, you know what I mean). I did tweak my ankle a little on the way down which made me skip the Red Castle alt. I was the first up of the day and passed three on my scramble down. Anderson to Porcupine Pass was an easy stroll with water constantly available. Upon cresting Porcupine Pass, I thought “DAMN, look at this basin!” The wall south of the trail is a spectacular feature. It was an easy stroll to the lake at the base of Red Knob Pass. Enjoyed a very colorful sunset.

  
**Day 4:** 26.4 miles, 4.5K vertical gain. Once again, I was up early for that dawn light. Red Knob pass was an easy 700ft of gain from camp and the light was nice. I made my way to the low point between Red Knob and Deadhorse pass before the sun hit it and it was COLD. Mosquitos were bas at Deadhorse lake and the pass was steep. I took the Head of Rock Creek trail to avoid the worst of the burn but there is still a mile or two in it. Lots of people between Rocky Sea Pass and the trailhead but that is expected for a Friday afternoon. Thunderstorms were rolling in as I made it to my car.

  
**Parting Thoughts:** So, do I recommend this trail? Hell yeah! Hitting this trail was different from doing something that is more well-travelled. I did enjoy the solitude that it was the hint of a trail. Overall, I had more fun than on the CT. My experience may have been skewed by the really nice weather window.  
  
Special thanks to Keith and Sarah for hosting me in SLC and to George from the FB group for the ride. It wouldn’t have been possible without them.

  
**Gear Notes:**

  
**Garmin Enduro 2:** Was able to track the entire hike on a single charge. Always having my elevation made the mental aspect of climbs a lot easier as I could keep track of progress. The topo maps on my wrist was reassuring as I often lost the trail and didn’t need to pull my phone out.  
**Tarptent Dipole 1 DW:** I was going to take the Li version but I couldn’t find the second strut in my car. The DW version performed great. Easy to pitch, had tons of room, and did well in the wind.  
**OR Sun Hoodie:** Got done looking pretty pink. I think I am still a button down shirt and big hat guy. I like the manual ventilation of a button down.  
**Fuji GW690ii:** A three pound film camera in addition to the point and shoot. Still waiting for the film back but I was glad I took it. The weight wasn’t so bad and I think (hope) some of the rolls turned out.

337,1692283330.0,ULA pack sizing confusion,"Hi folks,

I'm 5'11 with a 18-19"" torso (I've been measured at both lengths multiple times). I reached out to Peter a while ago for advice on which size Circuit pack to buy. He asked as well for my inseam (30-32""), noting that full body proportion gives a better idea of sizing than torso length alone. With all this info he suggested a Large size pack, which on the ULA website is listed with a minimum torso length of 21"" and suggested height of 6'. I pointed this out and he said it should be right for me in their particular sizing.

I took my large pack into REI for an in-person assessment of the fit and the worker helping me immediately pointed out large gaps between the shoulder straps and my shoulders/back (I didn't see this at home but possibly did not have the pack adjusted correctly). They added that measurements other than torso length are irrelevant to pack size and fit and couldn't speak to the ULA suggestions.

So, I returned the large ordered a medium sized pack (18-21"") and it looks much better. But I can't shake wondering about Peter's original advice. Does it sound off or am I missing something?

I'm very excited to have a Circuit and ULA has been terrific to work with. I just want to have my mind at ease knowing I got the right size before I take the pack out.

Thanks for any advice.",Ultralight
338,1692276410.0,Why UL meta is set to 10 lbs?,"This topic is going to be slightly controversial, but I'm going to get into it anyway because I think the 10 lbs meta is misleading, to say the least.  
On many hikes I've encountered people who are judgmental of other people's gear and concentrate on counting ounces more than being outdoors, same on many forums people are stressing about the ""divine"" 10 lbs meta, spending more time weighting their gear than actually outside.   
My main concern about that 10 lbs meta is it actually doesn't reflect person size so its actually much more forgiving to smaller hikers and there is why:  
Let's set two examples:  
Hiker 1: Average 5'9″ feet height, 160 pounds weight, size M  
Hiker 2: 6'6″ feet in height, 230 pounds weight, size XL  
Sleep system:  
Hiker 1 gonna be sleeping like a king in a regular pad, even as a side sleeper one pillow gonna be enough for him, for Hiker 2 it's 2 pillows, a larger quilt, larger pad..  
Hiker 1: Quilt- 11.76 oz, Pillow-   2.8 oz, Sleeping pad- 1lb 4oz  
Hiker 2: Quilt- 13.20 oz, Pillow-   5.6 oz, Sleeping pad-  1lb 8oz   
Difference:  8.24 oz  
Backpack:  
For hiker 1 its a 50l, short torso, medium hip-belt, hiker 2 is 60l, medium torso, large hip-belt  
Hiker 1: 21.1 oz   
Hiker 2: 22.1 oz  
Difference: 1 oz  
Clothing:  
Hiker 1 size M, Hiker 2 size XL: rain gear, fleece, t-shirt, socks, puffy, sleep pants  
Difference: 8 oz  
  
Total difference:  1lb 2 oz  
And I was counting crazy UL items with very little weight (basically 7D rain gear, Direct Alpha fleece, 10D quilt with 950 fill power, etc.), if you need to carry more clothing or go with slightly more durable materials the difference gonna become even bigger.

So now it's kinda unfair to praise someone to achieve 10 lbs base weight and tell the other one to cut his toothbrush, get a torso pad, eg. just cause he is bigger so the items he wears need much more material - weigh more.

* 192cm (6'2)
* Budget oriented Student
* Going Light (not necessarily 'Ultra')
* Germany Based

I'm mainly concerned with a tent that fits me comfortably lengthwise, and isn't too heavy, while not being much more than 200€ (220$). It should last me a few years for weekend hikes (2-3 Nights). I dont really plan on spending time in the tent other than for sleeping or if it rains.

The tents that fit the criteria are

* [SMD Skyscape Scout](https://www.68travel.de/produkt/six-moon-designs-skyscape-scout-zelt/)
* [Lanshan 1 Pro](https://3fulgear.com/product/ultralight-tent/lanshan-1-pro/)

I'm always happy about other recommendations. The main differences between the tents are that the Scout is 350g (12.3 oz) heavier (1.2kg vs 850g), packs slighty longer, and does not have a top vent, while having a larger inner, being able to be used as basically just the fly net and not being cheaper by just circumventing VAT+TAX. I'd personally take the weight increase for being certain that I'll fit the tent comfortably.

I know other, lighter, same sized,  tents exist like the [SMD Lunar Solo](https://hikerhaus.de/en/products/six-moon-designs-lunar-solo?variant=42649485181144), [SMD Skyscape Trekker](https://www.68travel.de/produkt/six-moon-designs-skyscape-trekker-backpacking-tent/), or [Durston Gear X-mid 1P](https://www.kaviso.com/products/durston-gear-x-mid-1p-tent), but all of those are are at least 100€ (110$) more expensive (sometimes due to VAT+TAX).

346,1692139653.0,My Thoughts on current state of Ultralight Filters including new Hydrapak 28mm filter,"Usually I'm backpacking with my family of 5...so since we are filtering 5x as much water, I get a bit ""particular"" about how well my system is working. Would love some feedback on my below thoughts.

I prefer to gravity filter at lunch and in camp, since squeezing is a pain. Still need a system that is fast enough though for the times we are on the trail and out of water and need to quickly filter 5 liters at a creek/lake. Last trip was like this ->

[https://i.imgur.com/u3qW1sJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/u3qW1sJ.jpg)

My cnoc slider was really hard to open/close, so brought the platypus which....sealed well against the sawyer at home....but....as soon as I got out there, of course, didn't seal well. (still worked but it had to be in the exact right position). However, the sawyer was a bit slow for quick filtering.

I don't concern myself with how well a filter seals itself (like quickdraw) for throwing in your quilt. A ziplock lets you take anything with you to bed. I prefer filters that allow screwing a bottle to the clean side, for gravity filtering and even for squeeze filtering, I hate holding a bottle between my feet and ""aiming"" water into it...its just fiddly. If you can screw on a bottle, I can squeeze in whatever position I want (standing, sitting on the cnoc (with a foam sit pad underneath and not with too much pressure), etc). Ideally the filter is also field testable but only 2 of 6 here have that. For protozoa removal, I would look at something better than 99.9% if thru-hiking (so consuming many liters of filtered water), or if you frequently do sketchy water sources. (I'm neither so 99.9% is still fine for me personally). If it matters to you...the quickdraw/versaflo is probably out for you.

I hate how there is very little inter-compatibility with threads between companies, as detailed below.

Anyway, playing around with the 5 filters ->

[https://i.imgur.com/M2AIW4G.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/M2AIW4G.jpg)

**Sawyer Squeeze:**

Pros: The gold standard, won't let you down. 99.9999% of protozoa removal, which is best in class.

The cleaning coupler is an absolute necessity here. Only $3, but is a separate part so you have to keep track of and constantly screw it on/off. Coupler works 100% and makes forceful backflushing a breeze.

Cons: Heaviest of the bunch. Has an o-ring that can come out. Of my 6, is the slowest, but not by much. No field test.

**Platypus Quickdraw:**

Pros: Only one that reliably works with platypus bags! (I really just need to buy some evernew bags though evernew doesn't make a good 3L).  Decently fast (ranked 3 of 6). Most people put the end caps as a pro but....again, just use a ziplock (I don't want to deal with the dirty end side cap anyway so always leave it at home). Big pro: Field testable!

Cons: No 28mm threading on clean side is HUGE con. Can't gravity setup well, requires aiming into bottle. Only 99.9% of protozoa removal. Many put the backflushability as a pro where it doesn't require a part...but of the 6 filters, this filter is the hardest to backflush. I like using two hands on a smart bottle for more force...so now it needs a 2nd person to push the filter against the bottle, tightly. Even if I did put the filter like between my legs and pushed, its still too easy to not get a good seal so now water is spraying out somewhere.

I tried 3d printed parts to get 28mm outlet connection ->

[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5610083/files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5610083/files)

But....3d printed plastic is too brittle so like...screwing on 1 bottle too tightly and the threads crack. Also, 3d printed parts can harbor bacteria and not be food safe.

Edit: Rumor is platypus is making a gravity filter adapter in 2024.

**HydroBlu Versa Flow:**

Haven't used in the field yet but shows a lot of promise.

Pros: My dream setup of connections. 28mm on both ends, with no separate parts, plus with end caps that are super easy to use. Dead simple, no fuss, filtering, backflushing and gravity. Also has a ""view port"" on the side to see filter condition.

Cons: Technically...you could screw up the direction of water flow if you were tired and not paying attention and have a contamination issue (hopefully that you spot before you drink). If it happened...I have micropur tablets as a backup that I could flush the filter with chlorine dioxide.   Speed is 5 of 6...so still a bit faster than sawyer squeeze for me.  Even though its a .1 micron filter, manufacturer only claims 99.9% removal of protozoa. A bad con is that the manufacturer states that the new versions do not work with smartwater bottles...but I have a brand new one and smartwater bottles work just fine? (and not fiddly either....they just seem to work no problem).

**Katadyn Befree:**

Pros: Unbelievable flow rate when new. Like...20s a liter (compared to 45-50 seconds for versaflow and squeeze). Field Testable. Speed rank is first of 6. Mid tier 99.99% protozoa removal. (gearskeptic found data that its actually 99.999%).

Cons: You are now married to 42mm bags, so you have lost some redundancy if your bag suffers a catastrophic failure (the others you can just use bottles as backup). Though, the opening is big enough that you don't have to use cnoc sliders...easy to fill 42mm from lakes and creeks. I used a befree with 2 people on the JMT and it did get painfully slow at the end. However, this was years ago and I didn't backflush it. ""Swishing"" in clean water....is a fairytale. Thats not going to cut it. Now.....it has a 28mm outlet.....but for some AWFUL reason the thread doesn't work with the sawyer cleaning adapter, even though you can put the same sport cap on both the befree and the sawyer and it works fine.   Fortunately.....you can still use the sawyer cleaning adapter and it seals well enough to do forceful backflushing. Yes, I know Katadyn says not to backflush. But...Hydropaks new filters are like befree clones and the 28mm version DOES completely support backflushing (see below). I feel completely safe with backflushing it...ONLY because its field testable.  Most people state the biggest con is the flow rate slows too much...but I'm hoping with strong backflushing that is going to be resolved. However with the sawyer coupler, it fails terribly in gravity mode and leaks too much. Edit: Katadyn now sells ""BeFree Gravity Camp Upgrade Kit"" that has a screw on cap for the befree to convert to quick connects (only fits the befree threading though), and hydrapak sells a $5 28mm filter adapter quick connect so you can basically make a befree similar to a hydrapak 28mm filter style output. Edit 2: I think I'm just going to make my own ""sawyer cleaning coupler"" by gluing two aquafina/coke bottle caps together (end to end) and drilling a hole through. (you don't want to use smartwater bottle caps because they leak on a lot of 28mm threads). That will solve a lot of my problems with the befree.

NOTE: Katadyn soft flasks do not have a cap that come with them, nor does katadyn make a normal cap. The befree is the only ""cap"" that works. Even though hydrapak makes the soft flasks for katadyn, the hydraflask seeker caps do not work on the katadyn (it leaks badly). I do not recommend getting the befree with either the 1L or 3L katadyn soft flasks and just recommend getting a befree filter only, and then a seeker bag that comes in a ton of different sizes (or get a cnoc 42mm bag).

**Hydrapak 28mm filter kit:**

Hydrapak....where is your branding? No real names given to these filters besides 42mm filter cap and 28mm filter? These are new for 2023...but...I have seen very little press/talk about them.  The 42mm filter cap looks exactly like a befree...but...with a cap like a quickdraw so you lose 28mm output threading (dumb). I'm trying out the 28mm version.

Pros: When new....very fast, though not quite as fast as befree, so speed rank 2 of 6. Really reminds me of the befree speed though where it just gushes out. Interestingly, manufacturer says 1L a minute...which seems odd for a befree clone and..my tests confirm that its way faster.  Has 28mm outputs on each side PLUS tubing quick connects which is a huge plus for some people (just not me), so highly modular. Easily backflushable, and is COMPLETELY see-through so you can see how dirty the filter media is, though...only small pro since I'll be backflushing any filter regularly. Mid tier 99.99% protozoa removal. (\*note, marketing says 99.99%, the online fact sheet says 99.9999%...and the printed manual says 99.999%....so...not sure which is accurate?)

Cons: Small con is 2 separate output pieces you have to keep track of, though one is always connected and there are small loops so you can tie the two output pieces together. (so at least everything stays attached). Also....its very fast to switch between the connectors since it uses quick connects. Also, after playing with the backflush adapter, its very ""short"", so to screw it on to a bottle its only like 1/4 of a turn, unlike a normal bottlecap which takes more than 1 full revolution. Fine for backflushing, but for gravity mode where you need the bottle to be loose on the connection so air can get in, bottle becomes very loose on the connector. (fiddly). Could be solved by using just the gray adapter with a sawyer coupler (which does work on the gray adapter!) Like the sawyer.....it has an O-ring that can come out unfortunately. Actually...it has multiple o-rings for the plug-n-play system, and hydrapak doesn't sell replacements, though if one breaks, they'll send you one for free. Hydrapak actually sent me the specs on the custom o-ring ( [https://i.imgur.com/KklOhr1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KklOhr1.jpg) ). Looks like o-ring size 11, 7.65mm ID (5/16""), 1.78mm CS thick (1/16""), 11.21mm OD  (7/16""), EPDM 80. I can find lots of EPDM 70 on amazon, so will try that. (70 is bit softer than 80). Edit: tried it and seems to work just fine (mr. oring on amazon...can get 100 for $12)

Pros: Very light (lightest of the bunch), small if just using the filter only. Speed is 4 of 6 (basically, squeeze/versaflo/lifestraw have close to the same rates). Has 28mm threading on both ends, and does work with the sawyer coupler. I would recommend getting the 1L collapsible bottle with filter bundle. The 1L bottle though heavy (1.75oz, vs seeker 1L 1.25oz) and not clear is absolutely bomber. More importantly...it comes with a 42mm to 28mm adapter which works better and has better threading than cannibalizing an old clogged befree filter. Note: adapter still doesn't work with katadyn soft flasks so avoid katadyn! Excellent 99.999% protozoa removal rate.

Cons: O-ring on input side. Not field testable. Speed is 4 of 6. I thought the syringe would be great, but it isn't: Doesn't suck up a lot of water and too easy for the plunger part to detach itself. A sawyer coupler works much better. Hmm, not really a lot of cons here...the filter itself is rather no frills but that can be a good thing. Just throw a sport cap on it and  bring along a sawyer coupler and you are good to go. Need more field testing and user reports to see if this passes long term durability tests.

Final thoughts:

I'll religiously use distilled white vinegar soaks at home to make sure there is no calcium buildup and afterwards flush with distilled water/micropur so it dries with no calcium and sanitized. Should make it so no filter clogs terribly at the start of the new season.

But...I hate that there is no clear winner here.

On the next trip...I'm going to give the befree another go. This is the solution I'll try:  [https://i.imgur.com/5EP0GMJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5EP0GMJ.jpg)   You have to source a lot of stuff: 1. Seeker bottle  2. Befree filter replacement 3. Katadyn gravity upgrade kit 4. Hydrapak filter adapter - 28mm 5. Sawyer cleaning coupler (plus a sport cap). But....it doesn't leak anywhere.  I'll be doing frequent backflushing. If it keeps up the speed, which is on another level of everything else, then even with 5 people, doing a quick fill up at a creek is no problem. The seeker 42mm opening is easy to fill even at lakes, so I won't have to deal with a Cnoc slider. 4.1oz vs 6.6oz (seeker 3l + befree vs cnoc + sawyer).

edit: I attempted to make a DIY cap adapter (by gluing two bottle caps together). They are made of either polypropylene or polyethylene, both of which are notoriously hard to glue. Superglue, jb weld, plastiweld..don't work. Loctite 2part plastic bonding system was close...but still wasn't strong enough to trust in the field. I also tried melting plastic ( like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjMB-IsvURo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjMB-IsvURo) )  but the heat deforms the cap and threads so it doesn't seal well. I did go back to a tornado tube, and to make it work better I hacksawed the extra length on both sides of the connector and drilled out the interior with a 3/4"" wood bit, and it does seal well against the befree but still leaks a bit in gravity mode on the bottle side (when needing to release air).

If it was a long trip (several weeks), I'll probably bring the hydrapak 28mm filter with a hydrapak plug+play 42mm adapter cap. That way I don't have to worry as much about a catastrophic bag failure and can use the filter on smartwater bottles. Or if I was needing a lot of water carries and bringing additional evernew bags, the 28mm filter would be the way to go.

edit: as an aside...I also bought a seeker+ 6L which looks like a great bag. Why can't normal seeker bags also be clear? And....why in the world does hydrapak have a 3rd filter type with the seeker+ bags thats just like the 28mm inline filter but without the 28mm inlet threading? They should just do the 28mm inline filter with the seeker+ bags.  The bag itself is much better than the katadyn 6L gravity system by far. And the plug-n-play 42mm adapter cap is fantastic!

352,1692084425.0,Trip Report - First Ever UL Trip! - Timberline Trail,"I do not post to subreddit groups very often, but I felt obligated to make one after spending the last few weeks learning as much as I could from this community! I have been a recreational day hiker and backpacker for the last 6 years, and it wasn't until about a month ago that I became interested in the concept of UL (Yes, I know my base weight is technically over 10 pounds - oh well).

Over the past weekend, I went on my first trip with a light weight setup and it was incredible! The trip included a 26 mile first day which would have been nearly impossible with the 25+ pounds of base weight I had been toting along. I am really looking forward to tackling more trips in my area (PNW) that can be done in a single weekend with this setup (ie; Loowit Trail).

The Report: 

Day 1 - 26.2 Miles. Started at the Timberline Lodge and went clockwise. First ever day with new gear (backpack, tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad). Ultimately ended up camping in a beautiful area between Cloud Cap and the Cooper Spur Shelter. It was really cool to see the forest meet the desert on the east side of the mountain.

Day 2 - 13.4 Miles. Woke up early since the forecast called for a warmer day. The section from the Cooper Spur Shelter to Gnarl Ridge was definitely my favorite of the loop. This section was also extremely exposed which was not an issue since I started at \~7 AM. Made it to the lodge shortly after noon and had a beer to celebrate!  
Gear Notes: 

I do not hike with trekking poles, but this trip might have finally converted me. The river crossings were definitely the toughest part of the loop and having them to help balance on rocks and logs would have been very helpful.

I realize I could have gotten away with a smaller backpack than the ULA Circuit for the gear that I carried. Ultimately, I want to do the JMT so I bought something that could fit a bear canister and still have some room. No regrets on the backpack decision!",Ultralight

I wrote this all up with pics on my blog, might be better formatted but the info is the same below just without pics.  
  
Pre-Trip Overview: This hike felt like four years in the making, especially considering how much time my partner and I spent hiking in the Uintas since moving to Salt Lake in 2019. We’ve gone back and forth about doing this for a while, but I’ve been pushing hard for this so we committed to doing it this July. Snow conditions this year meant that wasn’t feasible, so we pushed it back to the last week of my summer break, hoping weather conditions would cooperate!  
  
We went back and forth for a while about whether or not to hike the full UHT, starting at McKee Draw, which from everything I’ve read and heard from friends is a pretty boring and water-less 20-mile trek. Unfortunately, my partner got very sick with Covid just three weeks before our start date, causing him to miss the preceding training hikes we’d planned which put the whole hike in jeopardy. After he began recovering and experienced awful elevation sickness on a training hike the weekend before, we knew it was too risky to fit the full hike into the 8 day window we had, so this pretty much made the decision for us to start at the Leidy Peak Trailhead, cutting off the first \~20 miles of the easternmost section of this hike.  
  
The Leidy Peak Trailhead is a pain to get to, but thankfully Mountain Trails Transport is running shuttles to/from McKee Draw, Hayden Pass and Leidy Peak Trailheads. It cost us $200 each to get picked up at Hayden Pass (where we dropped our car), and get driven to Leidy Peak. Our driver and his wife met us at 9:30am (later than we’d hoped but that was the only time that would work for them) on Saturday.  
  
Starting Saturday 8/5 meant that at the absolute latest we had to finish by Sunday 8/13, as we both had to work Monday 8/14. We prepped food for 8 days, but an itinerary for 5 days, giving us flexibility in case storms rolled in or we needed a slower pace. I made[this AllTrails map](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/map/highline-trail-leidy-peak-start-option-1-25766f0?u=i&sh=7xkpof) with waypoints/notes using [this UHT guide](https://www.uintahighlinetrail.com/the-trail). This was our primary navigation tool on trail, although I also brought the High Uinta Wilderness paper map, which we didn’t use once.   
  
Food:  
  
Honestly food for potentially 8 days was a nightmare to figure out. Planning for 2-4 days feels reasonable and we often throw in luxuries ignoring weight, but that wasn’t an option for us this trip. Here’s [a pretty detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1POGk08igfVaPPgwORBMzQd3Vjm4W6lAtBON00h9-oaw/edit?usp=sharing) I made with all the food we brought on the trip. Initially we had 24 lbs of food and after feeling our packs we impulse cut a bunch and ended up with 18lbs of food. It was technically enough to get us through 7 nights, but we’d be running a calorie deficit regardless so we started eating a lot more once we realized we’d finish Friday.  
  
**Trip Report:**  
  
**Day 0: Shuttle, Lightning, Attempting Gabbro Pass – 6 miles**   
  
We left our house at 8am, arrived at the Hayden Pass trailhead right at 9:30am, and found our shuttle driver had snagged us a spot in an already overflowing parking lot. We hit the road by 9:45am and after a few bathroom and snack breaks along the drive, arrived at the Leidy Peak trailhead amid a raging thunderstorm at 2:30pm. Our shuttle driver, Clay, and his wife offered to sit with us in the car until the storm cleared, but there was no end in sight. We got out, thanked them and hit the trail. Then about ¼ mile from the trailhead lightning and thunder got way too close for comfort so we took shelter in some trees, and made a makeshift tarp shelter using our tent’s groundsheet. Rain and hail pelted us for over an hour as thunder loomed overhead. We immediately regretted our decision to do this hike, considered calling Clay to come pick us up, and felt like absolute idiots waiting out a storm that lasted hours. Every 45 minutes or so we’d brave the trail, just for lightning, thunder and hail to once again send us for the trees. We knew there was a long stretch without shelter a mile from the trailhead, and didn’t feel comfortable being that exposed in this storm. At 6pm we made dinner, as more hail pelted us in the trees, and we didn’t start hiking until 7pm, almost five hours after being dropped off.   
  
Needless to say we were quite defeated, but we were greeted by a beautiful sunset once we started our hike towards Gabbro Pass. Since this was quite a nothing burger in trail descriptions, we attempted to summit at night – following the AllTrails map I’d made using the UHT guide recommendation to hike around the north of Lake Wilde. Well, what we didn’t realize is there was a giant and incredibly steep snow field blocking this route over the pass. After about an hour trying to scramble the boulder field on the side of the snow field, we retreated and set up camp by the only tree cover around, knowing we were sharing terrain with cattle grazing the area, and worried about the lightening overhead. This was a horrendous beginning to our hike that had us defeated and ready to call it quits, we’d hoped to make it twice the mileage and so I’m calling this Day 0 because we barely got a start.    
  
**Day 1: Gabbro Pass to Lower Reader Lake - 11 miles**  
  
We woke up around 7:30am, Kevin had a raging headache and felt incredibly nauseous. We’d slept at 11,300ft, and he thought it was the elevation impacting him. After checking out our campsite in the daylight we were proud of ourselves for choosing the most sheltered place in the area. We followed the southern route around Lake Wilde to get over Gabbro Pass. In daylight it became very clear there was no way to get through the snow field on the northern trail. Weather cooperated despite daunting skies and we made it over the pass easily, and descended towards Deadman lake as dark clouds blew in and cleared rather quickly overhead. Dozens of cows were running around in the fields.  
  
When we got to Deadman lake we filtered water, ate some snacks and regretted not making it at least to here the night before. We passed several well-established campsites that would’ve been great to camp at. We passed one group of father and adult kids who were hiking to Fox Lake. The dad commented we’d be unlikely to see them again as he’s “old, fat and bald” so they’re slow hikers. We ran into them three more times as we played leap frog throughout the day.  
  
We stopped for lunch at White Rocks Lake, again wishing we’d made it there the day before. I dried out my socks which were wet from walking through marshes earlier in the day. Then moved along and ate dinner at Chepeta Lake, which was cut short by a thunder storm rolling in and dumping hail. We quickly packed up and kept hiking, only to encounter horrendous marshes on the west side of Chepeta Lake. By this point barely more than 24 hours into the hike I was deeply regretting wearing my trail runners (Hoka Speedgoat 5s), as Kevin hopped along through wet terrain with his Hoka GTX mids which kept his feet dry the whole trip. Every time my shoes dried out, we’d encounter more marshy, wet terrain and boom, wet feet again.   
  
We got to Lower Reader Lake around 6pm, at which point I was ready to take my shoes off and call it for the day. We set up camp at a little site between the lake and its outflowing stream. Another pair came through that were hiking the Highline shortly after we arrived and they set up camp not too far from us. We got a good night sleep at 10,7000ft, alleviating Kevin’s headache. From then on we did our best to sleep below 11k to help his elevation sickness. Still behind schedule we considered options to bail before Anderson Pass.  
  
**Day 2: North Pole Pass, Fox Lake, Kidney Lakes, to Gilbert Creek – 14 miles**  
  
Tried to wake up early to get over North Pole Pass before afternoon storms, but we were both sluggish. Finally hit the trail around 9am and were convinced this would be our last day as we were so behind schedule. As we neared the end of the tree line towards North Pole Pass we wavered about whether or not to attempt this notoriously long pass with dark clouds looming and strong winds. I ran a premium weather report on my inReach which said there was a 0% chance of precipitation and we decided to make the push.   
  
About ¼ mile up the ascent a switch flipped for me and I got so pumped, basically trail running to the top. This pass is fucking gorgeous, the ascent felt like endless rolling meadows with gorgeous views behind us of Reader Lakes Basin. The wildflowers were insane, I just couldn’t get over the views I was so stoked. Kevin was lagging behind so I had time for lots of selfies at the High Uinta Wilderness sign at the top of the pass. From the top of North Pole Pass I became determined to keep going on this hike, and really wanted to catch up to our initial itinerary. The next day we ran into a family that got caught in a snow storm on this pass the day before us and were throwing in the towel before Anderson, so I’m really glad we made it over with great weather as this pass seemed to really impact the mood of hikers. After descending North Pole Pass we stopped at Fox Lake for a long lunch, both hungry and tired from the last few days. This was the first time we set up our fly rod, and both caught back to back beautiful cutthroat trout (we thought they might be Goldens and got really excited – but after googling, it turns out there aren’t golden at Fox Lake).   
  
We made it to Kidney Lakes around 6pm, and this put us back on our itinerary which was very exciting, as we had planned to camp here that night. After making dinner at a lovely campsite we decided to push to get as close to Anderson Pass as we could that night, setting us up for an early push through that pass. In 2020 we got hit with a horrible thunderstorm as we were on the summit of Kings Peak (the highest peak in Utah), after summitting in clear skies the weather turned in an instant. All of a sudden our hair was standing on end, my trekking pole was vibrating and ticking and we hauled ass to get off the summit as quickly as possible as lightning struck all around us in the most terrifying experience either of us has had on trail. The trauma from that experience really impacted us a lot on this hike, causing us to be incredibly timid about weather as we approached each pass. So, we started hiking down from Kidney Lakes, and our AllTrails map showed this being completely dry until Gilbert Creek. That was not true, there were close to a dozen stream crossings between Kidney Lakes and Gilbert Creek, and along the way I slipped on a wet log and ate shit. Thankfully my hiking pole and pack cushioned the fall and only one leg got submerged in the water, but after getting over the shock of the fall my mood soured and I became fixated on just getting to Gilbert Creek and hoping there’d be a flat spot to camp so I could get out of my soaking wet shoe and freezing shoe.  
  
Thankfully after hiking a few more miles in the dark, we got to Gilbert Creek and found a perfect campsite right off trail by the river and we just immediately set up camp and knocked out.   
  
**Day 3: Painters Basin, Anderson Pass to Yellowstone Creek – 12 miles**  
  
Knowing we needed to get over Anderson Pass before afternoon storms, we woke up before sunrise at our camp, ate a quick breakfast and cleaned up. In the daylight we realized how perfect this camp spot was and felt grateful for the push from Kidney Lakes, even though my shoe didn’t dry out so I started my day hiking with a wet foot. Felt really grateful for bringing three pairs of socks, which felt excessive before we left, but was definitely necessary considering I didn’t have waterproof shoes.   
  
I was excited for Painters Basin based on our hike a few years earlier, and the hype from trail guides. Unfortunately, it was super rainy and windy as we passed through, so we just hustled to get to the base of Anderson Pass and didn’t stop to enjoy the scenery. We didn’t stop to check the weather at the base of Anderson, we just pushed ourselves as much as we both could to get up and over because we knew if we wavered we’d be bailing out through Henry’s Fork and not finishing the hike. The wind was so intense on the way up Anderson that I got knocked off trail multiple times while getting to the top. I’ve never experienced such strong wind gusts in my life, I tried crying as I continued using every ounce of energy to keep going but I was too dehydrated to drop a tear. Kevin fell far behind me which kept making me nervous but I couldn’t linger. He eventually caught up as my tantrum slowed me down through the awful boulder fields and disappearing trail. When we got to the top of Anderson I turned on my phone real quick, remembering we had service up here last time and we both mustered up half assed smiles to send a pic to our family letting them know we’d made it to the highest point on the trail. There was no doubt we’d be skipping the summit of King’s this time, especially given the wind, and so we began our descent into Yellowstone Creek Basin. The descent was fucking awful, the winds wouldn’t let up, it started raining, then snowing, then hailing. My face and fingers were numb and we were basically sprinting down this pass hoping to get to clearer weather in the valley below.  
  
The only thing getting me through the descent was imagining pitching our tent and taking a nap as soon as we got to tree cover. Kevin didn’t think I was serious but as soon as we got to trees I pitched the tent and blew up the pad. It was 1:30pm and Kevin made lunch as it continued to rain and hail. We ate, and then both passed out for several hours. Kevin’s legs were beat and I was just physically exhausted from fighting the wind. After rallying around 4pm we realized I’d pitched the tent on an incline, and generally this was a shitty spot to sleep. The weather had cleared and we could see how beautiful Yellowstone Creek Basin is. We packed everything up and hiked about ½ mile down the trail until finding a better campsite and setting up there. I didn’t really care about our lack of miles that day as we’d made it over our personally biggest obstacle, and there aren’t really good bailout points after Anderson anyway. We knew at this point we were finishing the Highline and we’d be back on track to end by Friday. We nestled our tent in some trees and prepared for a crazy gusty night. We slept right at 11k but I think Kevin was finally acclimated as we both got a great night sleep, although I was feeling quite nauseous around sundown. Temps dropped into the low 30s that night and the double down quilt I made us a few weeks earlier kept us both toasty.  
  
**Day 4: Tungsten Pass, Porcupine Pass to Oweep Creek, Lambert Meadows and Lake Fork River – 15 miles**  
  
We had a slow morning, still exhausted from the push up Anderson the day before. We had two passes to get over, but Tungsten is basically just a hill and Porcupine felt like nothing after North Pole and Anderson. We spent some time enjoying Yellowstone Creek, did laundry by the river and soaking up the sun. We hit the trail around 9am, knowing this was the one day that promised a 0% chance of rain or storms. Excited at the prospect of the first warm day on trail, I whipped out the shorts I packed and we quickly made it over Tungsten Pass and through the beautiful meadows and lakes to Porcupine Pass. Porcupine Pass was fun and quick, with great views at the top. It made us wish we’d had better weather over Anderson, as we enjoyed taking time to snack and enjoy the views on either side.   
  
As we descended into Oweep Creek Basin, we saw a sign from the DWR that said they were working on reintroducing Colorado River Cutthroat Trout to the basin, and that it would be fishless until 2024. Didn’t think much of it and we filled up water at a gorgeous creek, laid out our undies to keep drying from the morning washing, and ate lots of crackers, cheese and hummus.   
  
As we continued down the trail into the basin we came across a sign that said “DANGER” and that water had been treated with Rotenone to kill fish and that we couldn’t fish, swim or wade in the water. However, it didn’t say anything about drinking the water, which we’d already down a few miles upstream. This sent us into a little spiral and motivated us to get through this basin as quickly as possible to access water in Lambert Meadows where we’d planned to sleep. Cue more wet feet as I navigated marshy grasses throughout Oweep Creek. We made it up the ledge on our way to Lambert Meadows and made it to the most incredible lake we’d seen on this hike. It’s not on the AllTrails map but holy crap sitting right at the base of some peaks and on a ledge above the basin. We hung out here, dipped our toes and I scrubbed all the dirt off my legs from hiking in shorts for the day. This is also when I noticed the sunburns and scrapes and really wondered why on earth people hike in shorts haha.  
  
After finishing up at Paradise Lake, we made our way to Lambert Meadows and ran into another thru hiker who immediately asked if we also drank the poison water. Thank god we weren’t the only ones who drank it before seeing the sign!  
  
We set up camp a little way from a stream, and finally tried the chocolate pudding dessert I brought. It was so delicious and made us with we’d brought more! Lots of deer were around the camp, and we went to bed early knowing we had two big passes to get through and storms would roll in around 12.   
  
**Day 5: Red Knob Pass, Dead Horse Lake, Dead Horse Pass, Rock Creek Drainage – 18 miles**  
  
With both of us finally feeling really in it, we woke up before sunrise and quickly took down camp, ate granola bars instead of oatmeal for breakfast and were on trail by 7am to get over Red Knob Pass. The weather was incredible and we watched the sun rise slowly over the surrounding peaks. Red Knob pass itself was gorgeous. Tons of wildflowers the whole way up, and the views of the basin below were amazing. It got hot quickly, and we made it to the top by 8am only to be shocked at the views on the other side! About 1/3 of the way down the pass we were at the top of another pass and could see into two new valleys below. The descent was rough, with loose and steep rock, so we definitely understood the warnings to only hike the pass when it’s clear weather and had time to dry out.  
  
At the bottom of the pass we took a break and prepared to make it to Dead Horse Lake where we’d have lunch, fish and enjoy the views before embarking on Dead Horse Pass. We both caught Tiger Trout, ate a ton and then started to get anxious at the clouds forming overhead so we packed it all up and began ascending Dead Horse Pass.  
  
The pass was absolutely brutal, by far the most strenuous pass on the trail. There was a snowfield right along the trail, but it was too sketchy to risk crossing so we navigated the boulder field under the snow, and man that was rough. Any slip would lead to a several foot drop through massive boulders and definitely lead to injury. We stumbled upon what definitely looked like animal bones, and the whole time I kept wondering how anyone could think taking a horse through this pass would be a good idea. Definitely a fitting name! The trail completely disappears at multiple points, and Kevin and I had to be careful on switchbacks to stay close together. If either of us was below the other on the switchbacks we’d risk triggering a rock slide onto the person below us. I fucking hated going up this pass but I can’t imagine how anyone could make their way down. The views at the top were incredible but I still hated the pass. The descent was way better, a whole different experience!  
  
We made our way to Ledge Lake, knowing we were entering the remnants of the 2020 East Fork Fire, but it was so hard to find info on trail conditions before starting this hike. We’d initially planned to camp at Ledge Lake, but when we got there it was barely 1pm so we decided to push towards Rocky Sea Pass. We kept toying with the idea of getting home that day, so that motivated us to power through. I knew some folks were circumventing the burn area by going through the Jack and Jill trails north of the Highline, but it added a few miles and we weren’t sure of the conditions up there. So we tried to stick to the highline through Rock Creek Drainage. The trail was brutal but there were some signs of recent trail maintenance. We followed a mix of cairns and pink tags on downed trees, still having to bushwhack a ton to get around downed trees. After several hours we made it to Rock Creek, which we’d been holding out hope for a water refill and snack. We were absolutely heart broken when we got there to realize we couldn’t find a safe passage across the river. It was raging and deep in many places. Maybe we were playing it too conservatively but we spent 30 min trying to find a safe way across. After I’d fallen in on a much less treacherous stream crossing a few days prior, we really just wanted to avoid injury. We hung around and ate hoping we’d work up the courage to cross, but eventually took a detour route to get up to Jack and Jill hoping that would be easier.   
  
I cannot emphasize enough, this was the worst trail conditions we’ve ever experienced. It was 100% bushwhacking. Every time we thought we’d found a clear section of trail there’d be a dozen downed trees to navigate around. This 1.5 mile section of trail took us almost 2 hours to get up. Then when we finally got back on Jack and Jill trails, it was more of the same. Kevin ripped his pants, I had a breakdown. It sucked. We were miserable. We finally made it back to the junction with the Highline around 8pm, and decided to call it and set up camp. We were so mentally and physically drained from hours of bushwhacking and a several mile detour from the trail. We hadn’t seen another soul the whole day, until around 8:30pm when a hiker came down the trail as we set up camp. Immediately he yelled out “you’re the first people I’ve seen all day! Thank god I need someone to commiserate with!”. He said he’d down Kings Peak as an out and back from Hayden and stayed on the Highline through Rock Creek Drainage on the way there, but it was so horrible he decided to try Jack and Jill on the way back, which was equally awful. This validated that no matter which way we’d gone it would have sucked. This guy had an impressive long trail history and was adamant he’d never been on trail conditions this bad. It validated our melt down and exhaustion from what turned into a horrible end of our long day.  
  
**Day 6: Rocky Sea Pass, Carolyn Lake, Home! – 12 miles**  
  
Thank god we got a good night sleep after how sore and tired we were from navigating the Rock Creek Drainage section of this hike. We were worried we’d be too slow to beat the 80% change of lightning at 11am that the inReach weather report showed coming. Our tent was covered in condensation, the worst it had been the whole trip. Didn’t have time to dry it out so we shoved our wet tent and damp down bag in the stuff sacks and hit the trail before even really eating. Once we got up to about ¼ mile from Rocky Sea Pass we were out of the timberline and down with the horrendous trail conditions. The basin at the base of Rocky Sea Pass was gorgeous, I wish we’d made it slightly farther down trail to camp there. Rocky Sea pass itself was pretty easy and felt amazing knowing how close to the car we were! We’ve done tons of hikes from Hayden Pass Trailhead so we’re very familiar with the trail on the west side of Rocky Sea Pass. We stopped at Carolyn Lake to eat a hot breakfast and fish. We both caught lots of Arctic Grayling, then hit the trail to head home!   
  
After barely seeing other people for a week, it was shocking how many folks we ran into on the trail that morning. We got increasingly annoyed at the hoards of horse packers on trail, the kids screaming for no reason egged on by their parents, and ended up doing the last five miles as basically a trail run to the car. I always forget how endless this section of trail is, no views and nothing particularly enjoyable. The trail is a consistent uphill climb and very rocky, but with all the tree cover there just aren’t many sights. All good, we made it to the car by 1:30pm and the feeling of accomplishment was unreal! Thunder loomed overhead but we just missed it and got changed into our car clothes and hit the road home!  
  
Gear:  
Lighterpack: [https://lighterpack.com/r/fw3a9c](https://lighterpack.com/r/fw3a9c)    
  
Shared gear, we each had an approx. 11lb base weight which included over a pound of fly fishing stuff. We had approx. 18lbs of food total, and each carried about 1L of water at a time. Total pack weight on day 1 (after cutting food and ditching our second liter of water) was 24lbs for me and 28lbs for Kevin.   
    
Shoes:  
I really regret wearing my trail runners on this hike. The trail was so wet throughout that I wish I’d had waterproof shoes. Thankfully my shoes dried out quickly on trail, but going into camp with wet feet was super demoralizing. Somehow, I came out of this hike without any blisters, which feels like a miracle, but still my feet were wet and sore most of the time. I also wish I’d had a boot with a bit more of a firm sole, the rocky trail made my feet sore by the end of each day. In the end it was fine, the western side of the trail after Anderson was a lot drier, and while I did get wet a few times I mostly managed to keep my feet dry the last few days.   
  
If Kevin hadn’t been wearing waterproof mid boots, I wouldn’t have thought much of it, but my only pain point by the end of the hike was my feet and he had dry and happy feet the whole hike (but lots of other sore muscles!)  
  
Clothes:  
I made most of my own clothes for this hike, including my merino sun hoodie, hiking pants, shorts, alpha direct hoodie and sleep pants, merino underwear, and silnylon rain jacket. I also made Kevin’s merino sun hoodie, alpha direct hoodie and merino boxer briefs. We both loved our sun hoodies and even when we got quite stinky they held up, the undies were great and we were able to wash them in streams and they dried super quick clipped to the back of our packs. My rain jacket was perfect, usually when it was raining it was also freezing out so I didn’t mind hiking in it even though it isn’t breathable. Also worked like a charm for wind protection during some of the worst gusts. The mesh pit vents helped a little with body heat and then I’d just unzip as much as I could to stay dry.   
  
I loved my hiking pants so much! I made them with a lot of ease and that was perfect because I basically felt like I wasn’t wearing pants – which is perfect. I somehow ended up with lots of cuts and weird scrapes and things on my legs throughout this hike, even when wearing pants, but the pants didn’t get ripped or anything (just a little stained with blood…) They dried really quickly after rain and my accidental dip in the stream. I hated hiking in my shorts the one day I did. I kept applying sunscreen and still ended up with gnarly sunburns on my legs, plus even more scrapes, bruises and bug bites. I also couldn’t pee with my PStyle with the elastic waist shorts and pack on, so the pants with a zipper fly were the winner because I didn’t have to take my pack off to pee.  
  
Thumb holes < sun gloves:  
We both loved the merino sun hoodies I made, but because I hiked with poles the entire time, my hands got a lot of sun exposure. The thumb holes kept the back side of my hand from sun, but my knuckles got so sunburned that I have blistering on several of my fingers. I applied sunscreen every chance I could but it barely stuck to my fingers and now I’m paying for that. Thumbholes are great for day hikes or hikes with less exposure but no amount of sunscreen was a match for the brutal exposure throughout this hike so definitely team more clothes!  
  
Pack:  
Holy shit I’ve never had a more comfortable pack. I made [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvXGkHTOEvh/?img_index=1) with several features that I’m quite enamored with. The frame stays/suspension system are the best part by far. There were times where It was so hot I didn’t want my pack touching my back and was able to comfortably shift all the weight to my hips and barely have the shoulder straps/back touching my body. When scrambling in the Dead Horse Pass boulder field I got the pack to sit super close to my body which gave me great mobility. I loved having the shoulder strap pockets, all the external pockets, and the hipbelt pouch I made last minute. I got a sore spot on my right collarbone and can’t really figure out the cause. The plus side of making the straps removable is that I can play around with it to figure out the cause and hopefully remedy it. Stoked to take this pack on many more adventures and rally glad to see the seam taping held up. Nothing inside got wet despite tons of downpours!  
  
Sleep System:  
I made a hearty double down quilt before this trip. Weighing at 40oz and filled with nearly 2lbs of 900FP down, it’s a warm beast. It’s our first time sleeping with a down quilt, as we’ve been using an apex quilt I made three years ago. I was worried with how wet this trail was that the down would get wet and it would lose loft, but thankfully that didn’t happen! We had a ton of condensation in our tent (Big Agnes Copper Spur 2), which usually doesn’t happen. The nights with strong wind thankfully kept condensation down, but the few dry and wind-less nights got bad. The quilt dried quickly and we never experienced warmth loss, so that was a great relief!  
  
Neither of us brought our puffies, so we really relied on the quilt to keep us warm at night. It was great. We each brought a wool base layer top, alpha direct hoodie and then I had alpha direct bottoms while Kevin had wool leggings to sleep in. Cold was never an issue for sleep but we definitely got cold on trail in the mornings and evenings.  
  
We both got a little sick of pumping up the exped synmat UL duo sleep pad. We normally love it and get great nights sleep on it, but it takes like 5-10 minutes to pump up and that was a lot when we were already wiped at the end of each day. I don’t know what the alternative would be but this definitely was on our mind a lot. It’s definitely heavier than other sleeping pad options out there and we’ve been sticklers on keeping it since it fits perfectly in our tent, is one of the only pads long enough for Kevin to comfortably sleep on, but pumping it up and taking it down every night wasn’t fun.  
  
Water Filter:  
We went back and forth about taking the Sawyer Squeeze, but we also knew we’d want to take a lot of breaks and didn’t want to spend our downtime actively filtering water. We usually take our Platypus Gravity Filter with us, so we decided to just stick with what we know. We got into a good rhythm of taking 10-minute breaks by streams, filling the bag and sticking it in a tree or on a rock to filter while we ate and rested. This worked well and we’d usually fill four liters, each drink one and then carry a liter with us on trail. We never needed more than 1L on us at a time. This kind of forced us to rest every 5 or so miles, which was probably for the best.  
  
Food Thoughts:  
Dehydrated hummus was the best damn thing. Honestly, I haven’t been so happy with food on trail in a long time, something about hummus and crackers, especially when rehydrated with cold stream water, just felt perfect. Lunch most days was half a bagel with peanut butter and dehydrated bananas, with crackers and cheddar cheese or hummus and a bunch of candy.   
  
I don’t love the dehydrated milk, probably because I don’t normally drink milk. So I put the summit cereal in my oatmeal with peanut butter which made it hearty and delicious. The noodle and veggie meal is incredibly fibrous, which is all fine and good until you start running low on TP 😂 The Huel dinner was tasty, but the noodles never really rehydrated, this was even an issue when we tested at home prior to going. It was our first time using purchased dehydrated or freeze-dried food, and I prefer just making it myself.

357,1692029611.0,How much poop/bags do I need to carry?,"Next month I'll be doing a week long backpacking trip in Island in the Sky and Needles area of Canyonlands. They require folks to use WAG bags instead of digging cat holes and I want to be prepared - in the last place I backpacked that required you carry out your poop I didn't know this was the policy and thought I could get away with just using a ziploc. These aren't actually odor proof and it turns out you can't hike fast enough to escape the smell from behind you if it's tucked into your pack!

So I'd like to be prepared this time with proper bags. I picked up a multipack of Restop2 bags, but I had heard these could possibly be reused for more than one poo? Has anyone does this, or is it a one and done type thing cause of mess/smell? Is that just asking for trouble? How effective is this silica gel stuff? My mind is also going to weight I'm not used to carrying, and what is the minimum I can get away with? Each wag is 3.07oz, and I'll be out there for six days. (There is a possibility of a dump drop off as the road from Island in the Sky and Needles goes through Moab, so halfway through I may be able to reset to zero there.) If I only bring six bags, one for each day that's 18.42oz, but what if I have to poop more than once per day? What if things get liquid?? I also haven't calculated in the undetermined poop weight I'll then be carrying as well... that's going to have to be a guesstimate maybe equal or slightly more to the food weight because I am NOT going to weigh my poo.  
Thoughts/feedback/WAG tips appreciated. Thanks!

***Edited to add post trip update: before I left I had to revise my entire backpacking plan/route because of the lack of water. The heat in September and needing 3L+ per day is what really killed the original plan of a multi day loop. Ended up hiking out to overnight at camp spots but coming back to the car in the morning to get more water, so my pack weight changed entirely. Like I predicted I got fairly backed up and then my body decided it give a two minute warning before it had to go - so yes I pooped in a bag on trail. I'm very grateful for the person who recommended getting an odor proof dog bag to put the used wag bag in bc it still had odor after tying it off and sealing it up tight.

There was a good shakedown last week for the same trail that helped me get rid of another pound, but I keep adding items more as I force myself to be account for the little things that end up in my pack at the last minute. 

The easy savings is, no maps, rope, e-reader for 17 oz, kind of want new pack, hiking poles and tent for problem at least 20oz. But that's not money to spend right now.

**Non-negotables**:
Prescription meds by default. The big 4 aren't changing which is where the easy savings are. I want to start with maps as I like navigating that way. I can always ditch them and use Far Out as I will have that for a back up. E-reader is defiantly staying as I expect to have a fair bit of time to burn as I ease my legs and lungs into Colorado.

370,1691869112.0,Mold/mildew on z lite sol?,"Today i unfolded my 3 month old thermarest z lite sol and discovered grey-brownish spots in the foam ""valleys"" and some at the edges. Images [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/sm47lQn). 

Now im asking myself whether this might be mold or mildew and if yes, how to clean it in the best possible way. I already googled for it but came to no conclusion. 

I never took the z lite outside except last time, but never got any dirt or gravel on it.

Last time,1 month ago on a sunny afternoon at a grassy riverside, i used it only for seating, but fully unfolded, silverside upwards. 
When the night came around there was a mild condensation buildup inside the ""valleys"" but packed it up and went home. 

Unfortunately i cant remember that i unfolded the z lite sol again for drying. So the worst case might be that the i stored it wet and folded for a month in my room...

371,1691808339.0,SMD Vest Harness VS Others,"Recently I've been looking at jumping into the world of vests as I find some pain in my shoulders/neck/back area. Quite a few people I've read have new found comfort switching to vests. As I've been researching packs with vests, I've come across the SMD packs with their vest. The one notable difference I've seen is they have 6 connection points (3 per strap). When the strap goes down off the padded area it then goes to a dring (or something of the sort) that than shoots down to the hip belt and off to the side to the pack.

372,1691801835.0,Water Bottles/Bidet/Urinal,"So I’m working up my gear list for my first ultralight experience and thinking about what I’m going to take and wondering how everyone manages bottles. So obviously everyone uses smart water bottles and I’ve got a few of those, I figure two filled with water and a Sawyer Squeeze should manage my hydration. But also picked up a Holy Hiker bidet, and I’m going to be using a hammock and kind of liked the idea of just using a wide mouth bottle like a Gatorade or something for a late night urinal so I don’t have to get out of the hammock. So do people use one of their two drinking bottles for the bidet? Or should I go with 4 bottles? Two liter smart bottles, a smaller bidet bottle and wide mouth pee bottle? Not like it’s a lot of weight but the volume is maybe a lot? I guess I could start with a full fresh wide mouth bottle and use that as the pee bottle and recycle it at the end of the trip.",Ultralight
373,1691768456.0,Need new footwear for wet conditions,"Looking for some assistance:

I just came back from a week long trip and had tried yet another pair of shoes:  La Sportiva TX3s.

They were great in terms of comfort, grip in the wet and have a stiffer sole, which I definitely need.   Probably 12-20 times per day I was fully wading in the water, so they got soaked - and this is absolutely typical for my trips.  Trails are also typically very rocky.

However the TX3s took days to dry, and that's not hyperbole...it took 2.5 days opened up and in the sun on warm days before they finally dried after I returned.  I spent seven days in wet - not just damp - shoes...

I have also tried Altra Timps, Lone Peaks, various Merrells, Scarpa Mojitos and Astral Brewers.

My priorities, in order:

1. Stiff sole
2. Grip on wet rocks
3. Quick drying
4. Light weight

The first three are really non-negotiable.  The last one would be great, but I am done suffering in order to feel UL-Certified.

Appreciate any insights; Cheers!

**EDIT:**  Thanks everyone for all the ideas - really appreciate it.  With the trips I do, I am always going to have wet feet all day - in above the knees regularly in rocky waters, then rocky trails...repeat continuously.   Just want them to dry enough so that in camp I can put on dry socks and be reasonably comfortable, even if the shoes are still slightly damp (the TX3s were still sopping wet at the end of the day and as such, HEAVY).  I've purchased a couple of pairs to try:  Inov-8 Roclites and Mudclaws; both are lighter than the TX3s.

376,1691647365.0,"Aricxi tarp ""upgraded new version"" component weight measurements, plus a question about its material","I just bought and received the [""upgraded new version"" of the Aricxi tarp](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832779211319.html).  
  
Then I discovered /u/DeputySean's review of the ""old version"" vs the ""new version"": https://imgur.com/a/jpxX5NR  
  
The tarp has clearly been updated again since Jan 2020, when DeputySean wrote his review.  FWIW, here are my measurements of the ""upgraded new version"":  
392.4g = 13.8oz total for all components.   
6.0g stuff sack  
283.0 tarp  
103.6g accessories: (74.5g for 6x 5.5” stakes, 24.4g guylines, 4.4g bag)

(Yes, that doesn't quite all add up properly, but that's what my scale said when I measured each component.)  
  
A significant update is that there is now a bivy attachment loop on the inside by the foot, which was missing when DeputySean reviewed it.  
  
Given this, I'm wondering if there were other updates.  I'm specifically wondering about the material, since /u/DeputySean said:  
""The new version packs much bulkier.""  
""The new version weighs roughly an ounce more than the old version.""  
""The new version actually uses an older fabric (the same fabric that Ron from MLD ripped so easily).""  
  
Is that still true of the ""upgraded new version""?  The ""upgraded new version"" I bought claims to use 15D silicone coated nylon.  The [old version that DeputySean links to](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255799870006331.html) (currently) claims to use ""20D Double Sided Silicone Coating Nylon"".  I can believe that a 15D fabric would rip more easily than 20D, but (perhaps displaying my ignorance) I wouldn't expect 20D to pack up smaller or be lighter.  Can anyone give insight into the materials used on the various versions of this tarp, and the (relative) material properties?

Partly I'm wondering if it would be worthwhile to buy the ""old version"" to have something stronger, lighter, and more packable, even though I already have the ""upgraded new version"".

377,1691637957.0,"Trip Report - Larapinta Trail (Northern Territory, Australia)","I'm back with another Australian trail trip report. I've also posted this in the /r/UltralightAus sub. Long post, hope you enjoy! 

**When:** 25 July - 7 August (14 days)

**Where:** West MacDonnell Ranges, Northern Territory

**Distance:** 230 km (138 miles) split into 12 sections

**Gear List:** This is the link to my LighterPack - [Link Here](https://lighterpack.com/r/fspwuj). 

**Base weight:** 7.18 kg/15.84 lbs (consumables) or 6.78 kg/14.96 lbs without consumables. Yeah this isn't as UL as it could be, but you have to be a bit more prepared for water carries and cold weather. I definitely brought a bit of luxury items as well. 

**Gear Notes:** I didn't trial much new gear for this trip. However, this was my longest trip and I definitely had a lot of time to reflect on some of the gear choices I'd made on this trip. Here are some high level thoughts on my gear that stand out (good and bad). 

The good: 

- I wore Topo Mtn Racer 2s for this trail with Light Feeet insoles. These are a fairly new shoe to me, and I'd worn them for about 50 km before going on my trip on two overnight hikes. These are great shoes for wide feet and I got them due to most of my blistering coming from my toe/ball area and the wide toe box allows a lot more room. I tied these shoes WAY too tight the first two days and blistered badly on the side of my arches which was dreadful, but once I loosened my laces the blisters eased and all was well. Overall was very happy with these shoes, they got a fair bit of wear and tear but they are definitely far from retirement and held up really well. Also, I went up a full size in these shoes to my usual shoe size and was happy I did. 

- Injinji Toe Socks: I had two pairs, loved these things to bits. I only wear one pair, don't double line. Zero toe blisters. They did get super stiff though from the sweat/salt/sand so I would strongly recommend two pairs of socks for a trip like this. 

- Thermarest NeoAir XLite: I happened to find a great deal on a second hand pad on Facebook and never used this pad for a long trail before. I really liked it and rate it. Yes, it's sort of loud and crinkly, most pads are. 

- Clothes: I was pleased with basically all my clothes. The only real complaint comes from my pants which got quite baggy and stretched out on the trip especially in the waist. I'd probably opt for an elastic waist band set of pants next time, but I had a pair of Mountain Designs at home and didn't want to spend more money so I just used these. I wore wool briefs and bra as underwear, happy with that choice again. 

- Kindle: this is a piece of gear I have always poo-pooed when I see it on gear lists. It seems like unnecessary weight. However, I can honestly say for a trip of this length I was more than happy to bring it. They are super light (like maybe 150 grams?) and I got a LOT of use out it. I'd get in my tent most nights by 8 and read for a while or take afternoon breaks and read for a few hours. Would I take this on an overnight trip? No. But for a trip this long, I loved it. My partner has one he rarely uses so I just borrowed his for the trip and bought some cheap books on Amazon. 

The not-so good:

- Gossamer Gear Mariposa: I've had this bag for 2 years now and used it on numerous trips up to 6 days at a time, and I think it's just not for me. It does not carry weight that well, and the lack of load lifters really drags on your shoulders, especially with large food/water carries. It has some great features such as the side pockets and front mesh pocket, but overall, I can't get this bag to work for me. I'm probably going to sell it and get a NeveGear bag. 

- Lanshan Pro 1: This tent isn't that bad, but I just after long days I did not want to be arsed setting this thing up. I'd sometimes set up and realize I didn't like the positioning/tensioning so I'd have to move it and set it up again. I sort of wished I'd just had the ease of a free-standing tent and also a 2P tent. Pitching with rocks on a trekking pole tent sort of sucks, and I used my pegs as often as I could. 

Other gear thoughts:  

Some people consider tall canvas gaiters for this trip, both for spinifex and snakes. I'd consider this overkill. I didn't see a single snake and my pants protected me fine from spinifex. Canvas gaiters would be hot. 

I met several people who didn't bring a tent for this trip. Because it's generally dry on this trail, and there are shelters, a lot of people cowboy camp or sleep on the platforms. I'd say you can certainly get by with this. We only had some rain one morning and heavy fog another (which meant damp gear for those who did cowboy). You can sleep in the shelters on platforms, but I did find when I did that I got a shit sleep. I like the privacy of a tent, plus it gets you away from flies and ants and I can spread my crap everywhere. But assuming you don't get rain, I guess you could get by without a tent on this trail. It's sort of personal preference. 

**About the trail/trail conditions:** This trail runs between Alice Springs, NT and Mt Sonder and is a primarily desert and grassland landscape. It is very rocky, and rough underfoot. Trail conditions varied from gravel/hardpack, sandy creek beds, boulder scrambles and just general rocky terrain. Assuming you walk from East to West (most popular route), the first two days are quite flat but long. Most people had blisters by day 3 where the climbs start and it gets super rocky. 

By about day 4/section 4, I sorted my blister issues and started to get my trail legs. You get used to the rocky walking overtime and it did get a lot easier. Yes there were big climbs, but a lot of it was on switchbacks or boulder scrambles so I didn't find it too challenging. But you do have to be mindful about where you walk and how you step. Trekking poles were a lifesaver. 

**Weather:** Generally, this area experiences next to no rain in the winter, and the days are typically mild and sunny. We had about 1 hour of rain one morning, a few days of overcast skies, but most days were warm and sunny with cool night time temps. It did get quite windy on the high camps. Daytime highs were generally 20-25C (68-77F) and lows were probably around 5-10C (41-50F). When there weren't any clouds, the sun definitely got a bit intense at times as there is not a lot of shade and I definitely tanned despite using sun screen. 

**Logistics:** You can walk this trail going either East to West (standard route) or West to East. There are also options to walk it in sections as you can get to quite a few of the section trail heads pretty easily with a standard 2WD car. Some trailheads are only accessibly by high-clearance 4WD. 

The hike starts at Alice Springs Telegraph Station, about 5 km from the city centre. Many opt to walk to the start, but we took a taxi since it was a 25 km day. Zero regrets on this decision. The taxi was like, $16. 

Most end to enders take anywhere from 12-15 days on average to complete this hike and opt to do food drops along the way. You can do food drops at the following locations:

- Standley Chasm
- Ellery Creek South
- Serpentine Gorge
- Ormiston Gorge

You can do your own food drops or hire a service. Most go through a service and package the food drops and transfer back to town at the end of the trail. We used LTTS and I was very happy with their service. Our food drop boxes were at my motel when we arrived, we packed up our food and left it at the motel, and the company dropped all our boxes off and they were at all the locations when we arrived. We did drops at Standley, Serpentine and Ormiston. 

They also did our transfer back to Alice Springs at the end. We got picked up at the end of the trail from the carpark at 11 AM, and it was maybe 2.5 hours back to town as we stopped along the way to drop off food drops for other hikers. 

We also purchased our fuel cans through LTTS which were at the motel when we arrived and far cheaper through this service than going to a gear shop in town. I used 1 x 230 gram container (left partly full in a hiker box) and 1 x 100 gram container. Happy with this amount. 

**Trail Itinerary:** I'll keep this somewhat short, because this post is already so long, but here is the outline of my trip. We did change some plans on the fly due to weather and preference. 

- Day 1: Alice Springs Telegraph Station > Simpsons Gap (25 km/15.5 miles): Pretty easy, mostly flat, with a little climb at Euro Ridge and the end to Hat Hill Saddle. Stopped to fill water at Wallaby Gap camp. 

- Day 2: Simpsons Gap > Jay Creek (26.2 km/16.2 miles): Again, mostly flat. This section was not that exciting in the grand scheme of things. A lot of it was scrubby/grassy and not many views. Bond Gap was a nice side trip. Climbing out of Spring Gap and into Jay Creek was killer since my feet were pretty sore at the 20 km mark, but overall flat walking and not too hard. 

- Day 3: Simpsons Gap > Standley Chasm via High Route (14.2 km/8.8 miles): I thought since this day was half the length of the previous two it would be easier. WRONG. This day was hard as hell, and my feet were in immense pain due to blisters. You get your first big climbs and views this day if you go the high route, but the descent from the high route was rough. The final climb into Standley Chasm was kind of hard and most people I spoke to said this was the hardest day for them. It's the only day I cried due to pain/frustration. Nice views though. 

- Day 4: Standley Chasm > Section 4/5 Junction (17.8 km/11 miles): My bag was the heaviest this day with 4 litres of water and 5 days worth of food. The original plan was to stop 10 km at Brinkley Bluff, but we decided since there were lots of clouds, we'd keep going since we wouldn't get a good sunrise or sunset from a high camp. Plus we felt good! Amazing views this day, and not as hard as I anticipated. Also did the side trip to Birthday Waterhole. 

- Day 5: Section 4/5 Junction > Hugh Gorge (14.9 km/9.25 miles): Hands down the most fun day I had on the trail. You get some big views, big climbs, the infamous Hugh Gorge water crossing... God I had a blast this day. We also did the side trip to Upper Hugh Gorge (worth it). Longest day timing wise on trail, but I had so much fun. A lot of people say this is the hardest day on trail, but I actually found it fine. 

- Day 6: Hugh Gorge > Rocky Gully (15.3 km/9.5 miles): After a few big days, we decided to take it easy this day and chill out. The trail was really flat and easy. Quite a few flies this day. Woke up to the sound of dingos howling at camp, which was special. 

- Day 7: Rocky Gully > Ellery Creek North (13.6 km/8.45 miles): Since we were a half a day ahead of schedule at this point, we decided to have another short day so we could swim at Ellery Creek and have a chilled afternoon. It was beautiful. The water felt great, we had a little beach area all to ourselves. This was a really fun day, and basically felt like a rest day, since the trail was so flat and easy. Some people skip this site and go to Ellery Creek South, to get their food drop there. We opted to do a food drop at Serpentine Gorge instead so we could camp at Ellery North and I strongly recommend it. This was another highlight day for me on the trail. 

- Day 8: Ellery Creek North > Serpentine Gorge (12 km/7.45 miles): I think this was our shortest day on trail in terms of timing. There is a new track realignment on the north side from Ellery Creek North, and it was some of the best formed track on the trail. It was decently hard packed, and gently graded. The scenery was like walking on Mars and you had some great views. Easy walking day, I had a blast. We also did our second food drop this day, so it was about 1.5 km return trip to the storage locker. We also got apples and chocolate from day trippers in the car park here! 

- Day 9: Serpentine Gorge > Unmarked Site (22 km/13.67 miles): We decided to ramp it up a bit this day after a few shorter days. With the decision to camp at the popular Hermits Hideaway on Day 10, we wanted to be able to get in early and pick our spots. We did the climb to Counts Point lookout this day, which is an iconic view on the Larapinta. Then we climbed down to Serpentine Chalet Dam shelter. This was the original camp for the night, but we pushed on. We did take a siesta in the shade here, and then walked a further 6 km to an unmarked site, basically right on the trail. Great views all day! 

- Day 10: Unmarked Site > Hermits Hideaway (10 km/6 miles): This was our shortest distance day on the trail. We wanted to get to Hermits Hideaway early to pitch our tents so they'd withstand wind since we were camping high (about 1000 metres up). I got turned around a few times in this walk to be honest, until Waterfall Gorge. There was water in Waterfall Gorge and the only surface water on this long stretch of trail. We topped up, did the climb to Hermits, and arrived early. The site was beautiful, we found some shade and lounged all afternoon. Stunning sunrise/sunset views from this camp, and probably my favourite camp on the trail. 

- Day 11: Hermits Hideaway > Ormiston Gorge (12.2 km/7.58 miles): I knew we had the famous Ormiston Gorge kiosk at the end of this day, so I hauled ass all morning. The kiosk serves sandwiches, chips, ice creams, soft drinks and you can even shower here. I basically put my head down and powered through this day. We lounged like dirtbags all afternoon at the Kiosk and hung out with other hikers. We spent way too much money on food, sorted our food drop and took ""showers"" which was mostly just warm water. Better than nothing. Not a great sleep here, as it's touristy and busy. 

- Day 12: Ormiston Gorge > Hilltop Lookout (18.9 km/11.74 miles): I've done this section before so I sort of knew what to expect. We blew through the first 10 km in like 2 hours and arrived at Finke River shelter where we took a 2 hour break to chill out. Then we walked and took another 1 hour break in a creek bed before pushing on to the climb up Hilltop. It was hot and lots of flies. Once we got to the top it was sort of busy and windy. I pitched my tent with rocks, and avoided the flies until dark. Eventually I had to toss a few pegs in the ground because my tent was flapping like crazy in the wind. Not a great sleep, but the sunrise views were worth it as always. 

- Day 13: Hilltop Lookout > Redbank Gorge (15.8 km/9.8 miles): This was a super chilled day. I did the 5 km walk down off Hilltop to Rocky Bar Gap to resupply water and use the privy. There was a lovely picnic bench in some shade and I ended up taking like a 2 hour break here chatting with my friend and having coffees. We met a ranger who took our rubbish and then I finally pushed on. It was a boring, flat 11 km hike to Redbank Gorge. I listened to music to kill some time. Got to camp and chatted up hikers. Took the side trip to Redbank Gorge that afternoon and got in the water (freezing cold!!). 

- Day 14: Mt Sonder return (15.8 km/9.8 miles): We decided to cut a day off our itinerary and do the Mt Sonder return trip (last section of trail) at sunset rather than the usual sunrise route most hikers do. I had already done it at sunrise, so I was totally content with this decision. We lounged around all afternoon before leaving at 2.30 PM. It was hot as on the climb, but we arrived just before 5. This is the official end of the Larapinta Trail. I had my moment of reflection, ate one last Mac and Cheese dinner and walked back into the sunset. We walked towards the glowing horizon and walked without torches for nearly an hour. The stars came out, we stopped to star gaze, and got back to camp before 9. It was really magical, and I loved finishing this way. 

- Day 15: Return to Alice: We got picked up at 11 AM, so we just hung around camp, had coffees and walked down to the carpark around 10.30. It's about 1 km to the carpark from camp. It was about 2.5 hours back to Alice Springs, where I slammed some Maccas, showered, washed my clothes and had pizza with my trail friends. 

**Conclusions/TLDR:** This was a long post, and if you read the whole thing, good on you I guess. This hike is spectacular, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I think effort to reward ratio is extremely high. Yeah you sometimes have to work for some views, but you get some serious dramatic vistas and there are almost always big views, swimming holes or other things to see every single day. The hike was not at all as hard as I expected, once I sorted the blisters. If you were going to do one hike in Australia, I would say this is the crown jewel. Perfect length, perfect difficulty, stunning views and a real look into the Australian outback.

Update: thanks for all the advice here!! It has been a great help. I started using the pad straps and the quilt is warm down to the mid-20s. I haven’t tested it in temperatures below this yet.",Ultralight

383,1691582134.0,Mid-weight backpack suggestions with running vest straps?,"Hello,

I already have an excellent MYOG X-Pac backpack, but for conditions where my ultralightness gains a few grams or I go with the family (you can only be so UL when packing for your kid(s)), I'd rather buy something more durable and not risk tearing my UL pack.

I haven't found a backpack with the features I'm looking for, but some come close. I hope you have some suggestions or alternativly it may end up another MYOG project.

Must haves:Durable fabric e.g. X-pac VX21, 210D nylon, some 150-250 gsm dyneemaSome sort of zip to be able to grab your tent from the bottom/side of the pack (instead of carrying it on top in a roll-up closure.Integrated hipbelt pocketsPockets on the strapsLarge front panel size pocket (and side bottle pockets)Running vest style dual sternum strap (like Mystery ranch, Montane trailblazer, NEO lite 50)40 - 55 LRoll top to be flexible with volume

As much as I've looked, I haven't found a pack to tick all those. Some packs that I like but are not quite what I want:Osprey AG LT 50 (nice side pocket for getting out the tent from the main compartment)

Mystery ranch bridger 45 (closest to what I want, but a little heavy and busy looking)

NEO Lite 50 ( never heard of them, but not quite a hiking pack)

Outdoorvitals Shadowlite 40

Arc’teryx Aerios 45 (feels a little small and squishy?)

Klattermusen Raido 38

385,1691533313.0,Liteway Simple Down quilt review after ~50 nights,"TL;DR: I really like it and think it's a valid budget option. Temp is accurate for me.

Alright, for those who want some more info:

I bought this quilt last year through a third party retailer, as Liteway was not delivering to germany at the time. I got it for under 200€. It is the 850fp version, the 870+ didn't exist when I bought it.

*Weight* : I got a size L and on my scale it floats between 595g and 602g depending on humidity levels. This is over the given spec of 590g. The given spec for an M would be 540g.

*Size* : As said, I chose a size L, and am very happy with it as a guy who's 180cm (6ft) on a good day. I like to have the ability to cozy up in it and really have only my face sticking out.

*Quality* : No complaints. Stitching has held up great, material seems fine. It did develop a pinhole recently, but I believe that to be negligence on my part.

*Design* : I am now firmly in team closed footbox. I had my reservations about the versatility of a quilt with a permanently closed footbox, but I was quickly proven wrong. You can drape it over you just fine like you would a blanket, and if it gets chilly you just slip in a leg or two. No zipper to mess with, no fuss with buttons or strings or drawcord. Simple and elegant.
The footbox goes a bit higher than others I think, for me it is almost over my knees. This is just short enough to comfortably slip in and out at night without having to do gymnastics. Again, just perfect for me.
For my body, the shock-cord with snaps that is used to wrap the quilt tightly around you on cold nights is too long. I will reinstall the snaps without any cord and that will save weight and I won't have the extra cords dangling about. I appreciate the extra length however for those with wider shoulders or generally more body circumference than me.
The drawstring for the neck is great. Centered in the middle. No notes, wonderful.
I have never used the straps to fasten the quilt to my sleeping pad. I know some people swear by these, but they're just one more thing to mess with which I don't want to do.

*Warmth* : I am a warm-ish sleeper and I find this quilt is rated accurately, if not then a bit conservatively. I have taken it into subfreezing temps multiple times and was cozy with a 150g down jacket. This is in a borah bivy under a tarp, on an old XLite. The coldest I would take this without extra gear (so sleeping in baselayer, airmesh, puffy) would be -5°. If replicating, please use caution and don't take my word for granted.

*Closing thoughts*

I really like this quilt. It's my absolute standard for all outdoor sleeping these days. I've not experienced down shifting that a few shakes couldn't fix, I've rarely been cold in it (shoutout to the night I got Norovirus), I like everything about the design, and the price is very good in my opinion.

386,1691529475.0,Maah Daah Hey trail. May 16-21,"The Maah Daah Hey trail (MDHT) runs 145 miles thru the badlands of North Dakota, near the Montana border. The badlands are a really stunning geologic area. If you like hiking in unusual conditions and don't mind the heat and long water carries, this is a really interesting place to hike.

Our plan was to hike from Sully Creek campground to the Bennett campground NOBO. We ended up shortening the trip by about 9 miles due to rain on our last night and the horrible trail conditions which rain and the bentonite clay produce. We did a total distance of around 82 miles.

The main challenge you'll face on the Maah Daah Hey trail is water, not enough water and sometimes too much water. There are very few spots to get water on trail. We spent a full day caching all of the water that we used for our hike. We were hiking before the water was turned on at the campgrounds. If you go after Memorial Day there will be water at the campgrounds which are spaced about 20 mi apart. Most days we left camp with 4 L of water.

When there's rain the Little Missouri River gets high and the bentonite clay becomes a slippery, sticky mess that is really hard to move in.

May 14. We spent the entire day caching jugs of water at the water boxes and the campgrounds along our route. There had been rain for the previous 3 days and the driving conditions were very slippery and the trail conditions were even worse.

May 15. We decided to use our one spare day to let the trail dry out. We did touristy things around Medora, North Dakota.

May 16. Day 1. Animals. 22 mi from Sully Creek State Park to Wannagan campground. We were surveilled very closely by a wild horse stallion who was guarding his harem. We bushwhacked around them. We came up onto the Big Plateau and we ran into a bunch of bison which refused to move (they never move). We had a steep side hill to get around them. An hour later we ran into about 100 bison which of course we had to detour around. Somehow we messed up and got on to the Petrified Forest trail instead of staying on the Maah Daah Hey. In spite of the detour it was really fun pondering the history and the petrified Cyprus stumps.

May 17. Smoke, rain, mud. More mud. 13 miles. When we got up it seemed to be misty  but eventually we started smelling smoke and it got thicker and thicker. There was a strong wind blowing smoke from fires in Alberta, Canada. As we walked, it eventually started to rain and rained for an hour and a half or two. Not particularly heavy, but that was enough to create the infamous bentonite clay mud of the Maah Daah Hey. Bentonite clay is what it's made of and it is very sticky and very slippery. You get thick clumps on your shoes and anything it touches, making walking a real challenge. Our speed dropped by more than half. You know it's slippery when you intentionally step on bison poop to gain some traction. We were planning to do a 22 mile day but the mud slowed us down so much. We were exhausted and stopped at the Roosevelt water box.

May 18. 17 miles. Cool (55F/13C) and windy all day. We started at the Roosevelt water box and went down to the flood plain of the Little Missouri.

May 19. 12 miles. Brilliant sun and hot conditions (82F/28C). First order was to cross the Little Missouri river. When we started our hike the river was too high to ford. We were hoping that a few days later it would drop enough to be safe. It was about mid thigh but the current was not too strong and the bottom was pretty solid gravel. A fairly easy crossing. The real challenge was getting across Whitetail creek which was a complete mud bog, but we were able to find a bunch of fallen tree limbs and logs, placing them in the mud to carefully step our way across. That afternoon we crossed Devil's Pass which was used to move cattle from the plateau to lower grasslands. No way I'd want to cross it if it was wet. We camped at Magpie campground where we had neighbors and water. Yes, the first campground that has the water turned on. Time to rinse some stinky clothes and take a spit bath.

May 20. 18 miles. Hot conditions (84F/29C) We hiked from Magpie campground to the Beicegel water box to pick up some water, then a couple more miles to camp. The gnats were bothering us so we decided to camp on a windy grassy knoll. The wind worked wonderfully for keeping the bugs off but we had a very fast moving thunderstorm hit us. We had about 20 minutes of extreme anxiety while the storm raged.

May 21. Our plan was to hike to the Bennett campground and get a shuttle from Dakota Cyclery. When we got up we tested the mud conditions and they were nasty, worse than day two. We had to be back to Sully Creek campground that afternoon to get ready to fly out the following day, so we bailed.

This trail is in the middle of nowhere and hard to get to, but it's got some amazing sights and it's hugely unusual.

387,1691522838.0,synthetic sleeping bag EU available - google sheet,"Hello all,  
I realize that many of you swear by quilts. Unfortunately, it's not for me, as I move around a lot while I sleep. Furthermore, I do without products of animal origin as far as possible in life, so down is out of the question. Even more restrictions: Since I live in Germany, only products from the EU come into question for me. (Recently I had to pay 30% on top for the import from the U.S., I do that only in exceptional cases.)  
I have already gone the ultra-light way with a backpack and tent, but the light weight of the sleeping pad comes at the expense of robustness and with the sleeping bag at the expense of insulation. In both aspects, I am only willing to compromise to a certain extent.  
Intended use: I will use the sleeping bag in Central Europe at low and medium altitudes (below 1000m) in autumn, winter, and spring. Winters around here are usually pretty mild and -15°C / 5°F is rarely reached.  
  
I have collected a list of sleeping bag models in the following document.

388,1691493183.0,Gas Stove - Pre-heat tube vs. regulation,"1. Will the pre-heat tube found on some gas stoves make the valve-regulation redundant?
2. Will the pre-heat tube eliminate the need for 4-season gas?

I understand that the pre-heating will increase the gas-pressure, but will it make it even?... or will i still have to adjust keep adjusting if i want to simmer.

I look for a replacement for my Jetboil Flash 2.0 that will be better for simmering. Preparing rice is just difficult. Futhermore a position close to ground would seem more secure.

I looked at Soto Trek (with micro regulation) and Soto Stormbreaker (multi-fuel with pre-heat tube).I also looked at Pinguin Mantin at the local store (low down gas stove with pre-heat tube) at lower price available at local store but quality is not impressive.

390,1691439431.0,Best way to buy gear on sale,"I've seen people posting here that they often wait for the item they want to buy to go on sale. What's the best way to go about this? Keep checking the website manually? Use some browser extension/an app? Sign up for a newsletter? I've obviously bought some things on sale before but it was normally because I needed something that happened to be discounted or I was happy to get last season's trail runners etc. but I haven't really intentionally waited for sale on hiking gear before.

Also, when is the best time to do it? I would assume autumn/winter + Black Friday but then I've seen some clothes are on sale already. And which brands do good sales? Just the bigger ones? I assume not cottage companies. How about Montbell Japan? I've seen they have some outlet items - is this their version of sales?

And do sales mostly relate to clothing? How about items that don't really change season to season e.g. do Toaks pots ever go on sale?

Any tips on how to be wiser here would be much appreciated as this stuff is pricy!

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses. This is the summary and some of the tips:

\- usual sales rules apply i.e. holiday sales, shopping at outlets and second hand (r/ulgeartrade), signing up for email alerts, searching for promo codes

\- seasonal sales usually start in mid summer or any time after that

\- some cottage companies (EE, UGQ, Zpacks and GG) take part in Black Friday sales

\- it's worth to buy stuff off season i.e. warm jackets in the summer and tents in the winter

\- you can try emailing companies to ask when the next sale is",Ultralight
391,1691440178.0,Winter tent for snow load,"I've been searching for tent for 1 person, capable of handling a heavy snow load and strong winds. I would also like to cook inside of it in bad conditions. I would really like it to have decent ventilation as well. I live in the PNW and the snow is very sticky and wet.

I've narrowed it down a bit to a double-wall tent because they have better ventilation options. The 2 I'm considering are the Slingfin Crossbow 4 season 2 person tent, and the Hilleberg Soulo Red Label 1 person tent.

They cost the same for me (around $1100 CAD) and weigh the same (around 5.5 lb). 

The Crossbow ([https://www.slingfin.com/products/crossbow-2-four-season](https://www.slingfin.com/products/crossbow-2-four-season) ) has 10mm poles, the Webtruss, and the outrigger attachment for extra stability. It has a large hole and 2 gaps for ventilation, and more space. However the 3rd crossing pole doesn't go all the way over like on the Soulo. The tent is freestanding but requires staked out vestibules. There are very few reviews of it.

The Hilleberg Soulo ([https://hilleberg.com/eng/tent/red-label-tents/soulo/](https://hilleberg.com/eng/tent/red-label-tents/soulo/#link_detailsLink)) has more a proven brand name and is a more reviewed product. It has 3 9mm poles that make the tent completely free standing. It also had a large vent at the top.

Before you guys come after me for not getting a large pyramid like the Dumoid or HMG 2 person, I've tried the Xmid 2p in those conditions and the condendation is brutal, even with vents open. I also lost so much internal room to snow loading that I had to get up during the night and shovel multiple times just to have a narrow spot to sleep in. The snow is like wet cement, so don't tell me to just tap the tent to dislodge the snow. The mid style tents really need the bottom of the fly above the ground for ventilation, and the snow covers that up.

I know that my 2 options are not allowing me to be sub 10 lbs, but I'm still trying to be as close to that as I can, while meeting minimum safety standards. 

Please let me know if there are other products there that are comparable. I'm leaning to the Crossbow, but I would like to know what others think.

Thanks so much!

392,1691431777.0,Trip Report: Uinta Highline Trail,"**Where:** Uinta Mountains, Northeastern Utah  
**When:** 8/3/23-8/6/23  
**Distance:** 103 miles, 19K vertical gain, Westbound  
**Conditions:** I got to see the full range of weather the high Uintas have to offer. Only once was it raining hard enough to warrant wearing my shell, but it often just sprinkled. Got hailed on for about an hour, which was especially annoying as there was a strong headwind to accompany it. Other than that, it was mostly clear or slightly overcast with daytime temps between 55-70 degrees and nighttime temps between 35-45 degrees.  
**Lighterpack:** Continuation of The Year of My Frontier, however, baseweight was around 8lbs.   
**Useful Pre-Trip Information:** The most significant logistical challenge is getting to the eastern TH. Being local to Salt Lake City, I was able to have a friend help me out with shuttling, leaving my car at the western TH and getting dropped off at the eastern TH. Without this luxury, it may be best to fork over the money for a shuttle. I heard of at least one operator based in Vernal from another hiker.   
It is often recommended to start at Leidy Peak TH, which cuts off about 25 miles. If you want a slightly shorter trip, do it, you won’t be missing much. If you want the easiest logistics, just yo-yo the trail, turning around at Leidy.  
**Photo Album:** [All the good pictures I took, in order.](https://imgur.com/a/MQUHyXF)  
**Day 1:** 18 miles, 3.5K vertical gain. Started the day early in SLC and shuttled my car to Hayden Pass and had a friend then drive me to McKee Draw via I-80 through WY. Started the trail at 1 PM as it began raining sideways. The trail started off rather rocky and muddy and ran into some dirt bikers who may or may not have been allowed to use the trail. Hiked ¼ mile off the trail around mile 12 to get water from a beautiful spring. This is a heavily wooded section, and I’d recommend skipping it if you have the option.  
**Day 2:** 30 miles, 5K vertical gain. Finished the lackluster section and ran into the first other Highliners right before Leidy Peak TH. This is where the trail gets incredible. The official trail routes you south of Leidy Peak, but I took an alternate around the north side which provided nice views of Flaming Gorge and some cell service for Verizon. This trail is not on any maps but is well cairned and easy to follow. Basically, the entire day was in the pristine alpine or bogs, with the trail occasionally disappearing. The first pass you come to is Gabbro Pass, which was still quite snowy. I didn’t want to deal with climbing steep snow so I scrambled up the eastern ridge which was easy for me as a climber with a light pack, but I hesitate to recommend it to others. Note: to my understanding, all the hikers behind me went over the snowy pass without incident. Made good time all day, and saw a beautiful moose in one of the bogs I passed through mid-day. Wrapped up the day by going over North Pole Pass, and camped at the first comfortable site.  
**Day 3:** 25 miles, 5K vertical gain. I was looking forward to climbing Kings Peak (Utah’s high point) and was trying to make good time in the morning to allow for the bonus miles. However, about 5 miles out from Anderson Pass (where you access the scramble to Kings Peak) it started intermittently raining and hailing with the sky turning dark immediately. As I approached Anderson Pass, I begin seeing a swathe of hikers there solely to summit the peak. I was astonished by the number of blue jeans and t-shirt equipped people heading up to the summit as it was approximately 50 degrees, hailing, gusts over 40 mph, with lightning overhead. I’m no safety police, but damn. I observed approximately 50 people attempting to summit in these conditions. I took a short break on top of the pass and got a bit of service for a call home. Obviously, I skipped the scramble to the peak and went on with my day. Pushed myself hard over Porcupine Pass, and my feet were feeling thrashed from the miles and constant wetness from the bogs. This was probably my favorite descent from any pass to date, as you get shot out into a 5-mile-long valley meadow. Camped at the end of the valley once I reached the treed area.   
**Day 4:** 30 miles, 5.5K vertical gain. This was my final push, as I was running out of food and battery, and I foolishly planned to average 3 mph over the course of the day. I was hiking by 5, and the miles were easy at the start of the day. I made my way over Red Knob Pass and met another Highliner going the opposite direction just before heading over Dead Horse Pass. Dead Horse Pass was the gnarliest of all the passes on this trail, with the trail being narrow and loose. Use trekking poles and take careful steps and you’ll do just fine. Admittedly, I didn’t read anything about trail conditions before leaving to allow for an element of “adventure.” So, when I showed up to the burn area between Dead Horse and Rocky Sea Passes, I was essentially stopped in my tracks. For the better part of 4 miles, the trail is almost nonexistent with hundreds of blowdowns to climb over and around. What I imagined taking me 90 cruisy minutes when planning, took me over 3 heinous hours in reality. Getting to the base of Rocky Sea Pass was a relief, even though I still had nearly 10 more miles to go, it seemed to be the easiest thing without the hindrance of blowdowns. Kept a healthy pace for the remainder of the day with the thoughts of pizza, beer, and my bed swirling around in my head. Finished just before 7 that night and proceeded to drive home.  
**Parting Thoughts:** So, do I recommend this trail? Yes, if you're one to be okay with a trail that's rough around the edges. You’ll often lose the trail and have to get back on via cross-country travel, but for me, that’s fun! You’ll always have wet feet due to crossing frequent bogs, just have to plan for longer daily breaks to dry out.   


**Gear Notes:**   
**Nashville Packs Cutaway:** Perfect as always, already had a thousand-plus miles on it and will last for thousands more. I’m a running vest strap guy, and I love never having to take the pack off with the ungodly amount of accessible outside storage.   


**Tarptent Aeon Li:** I’ve grown tired of single-person tents, they’re just too small in general. While the carbon strut design is super neat from a design and engineering aspect, it’s just a pain in the ass to pack being so tall. Planning on using my 7x9 tarp for fairweather hikes, and a duplex or the like for hikes with more substantial weather.  
**Fairpoint PowerWool SunCruiser**: Lovely sun hoodie that I bought on a whim recently. I wouldn’t wear it in the desert, but for more mild temperature-wise but exposed trips, it really is the perfect material. Kept me slightly warm in the cool mornings and evenings, and cool in the heat of the day.  
**Mini Bodyglide Stick:** This saved my feet. I put a healthy layer on after drying my feet and putting my socks back on. I’m not generally blister-prone, but I surprised myself that despite constant water-logged socks, I remained blister free. ",Ultralight

The Report: 

I set out to do a thru hike of the PCT starting March 22 with my partner and it effectively turned into a disjointed section hike. Lots of lurking here, reading online and trying to think through gear got me to my starting lighterpack. We hiked until we got to Kennedy Meadows South and decided that since neither of us had real snow skills the Sierras this year was not the place to try to teach ourselves. Nor was slogging through the snow for a month or so what we were looking for from our time hiking. We had some friends having various events over June and so we took about 5 weeks off trail to spend with friends and then came back to Cascade Locks to hike the Washington section since we both live in Washington and really wanted to experience the PCT section of the state. We are planning on going back to complete the sections we skipped on another year though.

Desert section 22/03/2023 - 22/05/2023. 
Started off with 10 mile days to get used to hiking that consistently. Built up to 15s and then did 5 20 mile days in a row to get into Wrightwood from bigbear. After that we did 18-25 mile days consistently. Weather was weird by average pct standards I felt. Random snow storm dumped 3 inches of snow the night before hiker town/aqueduct. The aqueduct day was in the 40s with a constant wind. Lots of cold rainy days. 

Washington 06/07/2023-07/08/2023
Cascade locks to white pass was on the whole quite lovely. Lots of swimming in alpine lakes, occasional bouts of running from mosquitos hordes, and met lots of “snobos” to discuss the weirdness of the PCT this year. White pass to Snoqualmie had so much unburied poop though, almost every campsite had poop unburied and covered with sticks/rocks or used tp. Some under bushes, some literally next to a campsite or in the case of the cabin in that section literally next to the trail in multiple spots. We treated our water with aquamira tabs in this section just to be safe. There was some gorgeous lakes and views in the section. We got off trail for a concert for 2 days at Snoqualmie. Snoqualmie to Steven’s pass was our only night of real rain, with only about 1-2 hours of hiking in the rain required. The mosquitos in this section were better than from white pass to Snoqualmie as well. Steven’s pass to Mazama: I felt this section went pretty quickly, we did 20-25 miles a day. One day had collectively 5k ft of elevation gain and was pretty rough. But otherwise very doable day to day. Lots of great views and a great swim at lake Micah. Did a zero at Mazama to get bakery food and our resupply box. Mazama to northern terminus. The Last push, we were pretty tired at this point but it felt nice to finish the hike even though it was very different than how we wanted to finish it when we started. Gorgeous scenery most of the way.

Gear Notes: 

What worked well
-Feathered Friends Flickr, it really had a “it just works” factor that made me rarely contemplate it. Used it in everything from a surprise snow storm right before hiker town to sleeping in Washington’s summer. Always very happy with it. 

-Moutainhardware Airmesh hoodie. Really punches above its weight with the warmth I got from it. It’s also the only real insulation layer I used, I carried my feathered friends eos but found it too hot on all but the coldest and windiest nights in camp.

-Injinji liner sock, maybe I was just lucky but I always used these liner socks with a darn tough sock over them and had zero blisters doing my hiking. 

-GG thinlite pad. It does look much worse for the wear but it still does its many faceted job well. Sit pad, nap pad, protects gear from dust/water while I’m repacking, fan, shade. It served a lot of roles for me and I will buy again as soon as this one finally dies. Though I do wish it was slightly wider. 

-HMG southwest 3400. Not the lightest, but it fit and served me very well. I was hardly kind to it but it took 1200 miles with little more than picking up some dust and sweat for the trouble. 


What got changed out and why

-TarpTent dipole 2 ->Slingfin Portal 2. Ventilation is great, interior space is great and not worrying about your feet or head hitting the ceiling as a 6’0” guy. But it doesn’t do super well in the wind and we ran into a week or 2 of very windy days unfortunately. And so swapped it out with the slingfin for the rest of the hike to have more peace of mind. Also I will admit the wind issues could be my abilities with pitching it or some other user error. But the slingfin has been rock solid. I really liked their internal and external tension system for dealing with wind. Really is a set it and forget it shelter. We experienced pretty hard rain, lots of windy nights, and more mosquitos than I care to remember and never had an issue with this tent. 


-Nitecore 20k -> Anker 20k battery bank. The nitecore was lovely when it worked. I babied it for 200 miles of the trail and then it just stopped working for awhile out of the blue. Then started working, then wouldn’t charge itself, then wouldn’t charge other things but would charge itself. Then it was adopted by a guy who thought he could fix it and I ordered an anker battery to replace it and haven’t had one issue since. Also I liked having the flexibility of not having to worry about charging things in town and just being able to pop in and out without worrying about my electronics dying. Managed 9 days in Washington without a recharge for me and my partner with just this, so I count it as a win. 

-MSR pocket rocket. My BRS wouldn’t really adjust after about 300 miles, it would turn on with a low flame and you couldn’t get it to do more, only shut off. So I got my pocket rocket mailed from home and never worried with buying another. 

-Granite gear food bag -> Ursack. Washington state changed their bear requirements this year (I believe). So we picked up ursacks as our food bags to comply. Originally we paired them with opsaks, but my opsak ripped by Snoqualmie and so I just did my best after that with the ursack and used bear boxes where I could find them to be safe. 

Exofficio -> Sax underwear. I had high hopes for the exofficio. I used 2 pair starting from campo and swapped them every 1-2 days. But by Kennedy Meadows they were terrible. They would stretch out and be loose and sliding around before I was done of hiking for the day. Which led to a lot of frustration. Picked up a pair of sax quest underwear for Washington and 1 pair did 500 miles with no issues at all. No stretching, sagging or fraying. Odor was what you would expect, not great but not terrible but I washed them every 2-3 days and slept in just my shorts to let them dry out each night. Big fan. 

REI-> Matador towel. Found the matador towel in a hiker box decided to give it a try. It dries in like 20 minutes on a sunny day and feels like it weighs nothing. It really won me over. Was the only towel I carried from Tehachapi onwards.

What got ditched

-All the winter/ Sierra gear. Didn’t go into the Sierras and so didn’t need a lot of it. The FF eos proved to be too warm for camp and the Patagonia leggings were never needed as my sleeping bag was more than adequate. 

-Gloves. I picked up some montbell “wind mittens” in Julian and used those more than the fleece gloves I started with. Often just getting the wind off my hands while hiking was enough. Ended up ditching both for Washington as the summer here doesn’t get that cool.

-Rain gear. Washington doesn’t get a ton of rain in the summer, compared to the winter, and after a couple poor experiences with the arc'teryx wetting out and then not performing well at all even after washing with the correct gear wash I opted for an emergency poncho and to simply hope I didn’t encounter serious rain. Only had 1 small rain storm to hike through thankfully.

-cork ball. Didn’t use it nearly often enough to keep moving it about in my pack. 

-S2S mug. Stellar camp mug. Loved it for hot tea on a cold morning. But I ended up using it very infrequently and ditched it before starting from cascade locks. 

-Appalachian gear beanie. Just wanted to mention this as I didn’t see it a lot when reading about it. It did work well from an insulation perspective and was super light/packed small. But my god was it itchy. Like grandma’s knit sweater in a 90s cartoon itchy. I ended up just using my buff and donated mine to a hiker box somewhere along the way.",Ultralight
394,1691425280.0,UL Pack made for hiking that can also carry skis,"Hey all,

Well seasoned long distance ul hiker here.

I live in western Wyoming and spend all summer in the winds, and all winter in the mountains in the backcountry.  


I have it as my goal this year to snowboard every month, just finished up my trip for August!  I have been using a granite gear crown2 60 for 6 years now, and while I love the pack I think it's time for an upgrade all around, especially after doing a trip carrying a splitboard on it. I could really feel the lack of the frame, and the shoulder straps were killing me.  I'm looking for a new pack for hiking trips, that can also carry skis A frame style.  I dont need a dedicated winter ski pack, I already have a nice scott airbag for that.

Here is what I'm looking for

-50 + liter capacity

-I prefer roll top enclosure, but would take anything

-hip pockets

-Durable side straps for ski carry

-some sort of suspension/frame

-I love a stretchy mesh pocket on the front


Again, I'm not looking for a dedicated winter backcountry skiing pack, I'm looking for a pack that I can use for all backpacking trips, that would also be more comfortable for carrying skis.

My base weight is about 9.5 lbs, and my snowboard setup weighs around 13 lbs.

Is there anyone that makes a pack that can fit this criteria?",Ultralight
395,1691417017.0,Using a Ursack Properly,"A lot of you probably already know these guidelines, but I've been reading and seeing (YouTube) a lot of confusing information about using the Ursack across social media. So, I thought I would offer this PSA:

I called Ursack just now and spoke with one of their customer service reps. The rep said **it's perfectly acceptable to tie the Ursack to a tree trunk or a limb that is at least 8"" in diameter.**

While she said that the height doesn't really matter, she did agree that tying it as high as possible is a good idea so that the bear cannot gain leverage on it.  When tying to a tree trunk, it's a good idea to have a tree limb underneath the line so that the bag can not be dragged down or fall to the base of the tree where a bear can get leverage on it. So either method supposedly works.Finally, **she stressed that Ursack is a bear resistant bag that will withstand a bear's attempts to breach it for up to 60 minutes.**

She said that people are letting the bear have access to the bag all night long, and they are disappointed to find that their bag and food are ruined in the morning. She specifically said that you should keep your Ursack 100 yards away from your camp, or whatever the local regulations suggest, but close enough that you can hear if a bear is trying to get into your Ursack. Then, you must go out and scare the bear away.I have several problems with this plan. First of all, you have to confront a bear and try to scare it away. Black bears are skittish by nature, but a habituated bear will simply ignore you, or worse, get annoyed with you. I can see that potentially not ending well. Secondly, this method also requires you to be a light sleeper and keep an ear out for critters. When I go to bed, I don't want to be thinking about protecting my food. I want to sleep knowing that it's as safe as it's going to get. For me, I'm going to have to seriously consider if this product is worth keeping.

I absolutely despise carrying a bear canister. They are difficult to fit all my food inside, and they are bulky and uncomfortable to carry. But, they do provide peace of mind. I wish more official campsites had permanent bear boxes and lockers or giant posts. But, even then, that wouldn't solved the problem of camping in dispersed sites. So, back to the bear canister, I guess.

Edit: Reading through the posts here, I should've added that Ursack recommends that you use their product with an odor proof bag. They specifically recommend OPsak. I made the assumption that it is given that you're using one if you're using an Ursack.",Ultralight

397,1691366453.0,Best UL Dry Bag?,"What are you all using for light, secure dry bags these days?

I have to carry some medical electronics with me into the backcountry (CPAP, lithium battery, etc.), and I'm looking for the best way to keep them secure from water.  I'll either have the electronics in the tent with me or in my pack during the day.  My packs are made of Hybrid DCF or X-Pac, so they're waterproof except at the seams.  I do a lot of backcountry fishing, but I've never gotten wet above my waist.  If I ever fell in (unlikely), the streams are small enough that I should be out of the water pretty quickly.

Any thoughts on the balance of weight and security in the dry bag market, given these conditions?  (Also, I'm not interested in discussing other options for sleep therapy.  This is the best solution my doctor and I have come up with given my particular needs.  Just hoping to hear about dry bags.)

398,1691349056.0,Trip Report: Sawtooth Wilderness Half Loop (Bailed),"Where: Sawtooth Wilderness, Idaho. Grand Jean Campground to Redfish Lake (and then some).

When: August 3 - 5, 2023.

Total Miles: ~57ish

Conditions: One partly sunny day, then off-and -on rain, thunder, and hail. Temps ranged from high 70's to low 40's at night. The bugs were barely noticable except near the lakes. Just a few mosquitoes, but nothing intolerable.

https://imgur.com/a/badhkZo

Pre trip info: I used the All Trails Grand Sawtooth Loop route. There was tons of water, I carried no more than a liter at a time. Seemed like every 25-30 minutes there were streams, lakes, or springs...at least on the section I completed (which would be the lower half of the loop, counter clockwise).

Day 1: I did 17.5 miles, starting from Grand Jean CG, beginning at about 9:15 am. The first several miles were pretty thick forest, and soggy thanks to a storm the previous night. Plenty of other hikers, horseback riders, etc. The weather was alright, and there was plenty of cloud cover but nothing that looked very threatening. Got to camp around 6:30pm at Upper Cramer Lake, and fit my tent as best I could between some trees as there were lots of others already there. I could have probably hiked a little ways more and got a better spot, but I was just exhausted and didn't care. Started to drizzle around 8 I think, but let up after a bit. 

Day 2: Hiked from Upper Cramer Lake to Redfish Lake, ~25 miles. Started around 6:30 am. I wasn't quite sure of my mileage since I stopped tracking for a while because it was draining too much battery. This was a beautiful hike, and I enjoyed some amazing vistas in the early morning all to myself. Meadows, rocky fields with jagged peaks overhead resembling Mordor, long winding sights of the switchbacks ahead...awesome. Then later came the hike up the Redfish Trail out of Hell's Roaring Lake. It was a bitch and a half.

The trail went from windy beautiful switchbacks and rolling cruiser trail, to unmaintained (in a while), blow downs, and practically straight up. On the way down, it was just as steep. After what seemed like hours of this type of hiking over multiple climbs and descents, it started raining fairly hard. I put on my rain jacket and pulled out the umbrella. I made it to Redfish Lake around 7pm. I set up at an ok little spot by the shore and was a little worried I'd get heavy condensation, but it wasn't bad in the morning. There were constant boats and commotion from the lodge. Still, I managed to get some o.k. sleep.

Day 3: Woke up again around 6:30am,  packed up my wet tent and put on my wet shirt, socks, shoes, and got to hiking. It was super cloudy, much to my disappointment. I hiked the length of the lake, and began the ascent above it. My knee started to really bother me, thanks to my overuse the previous day. I got quite a ways past the lake, and decided I'd had enough. With my knee hurting, the rain not stopping (with audible thunder now, and bouts of hail), I hiked back to Red Fish Lake. A really nice couple gave me a ride back to my car. That was that. I probably hiked around 15 miles this day in total, but wasn't really tracking.

I know I pushed myself too much, but I still really enjoyed the hike. Although I had plans to go further, I couldn't justify it and decided not to put myself into a troublesome situation. I need to get back into better shape. Even with a light pack, your body still needs to be able to do it's part!

As far as gear, I feel that I made great decisions. I don't have a lighterpack put together atm but I have everything listed that I brought. It was the maiden voyage for my MLD Burn. Loved it, very comfy, and an all around nice carry. Loaded it with about 4 days of food, and no more than a liter of water at a time (thanks to the aformentioned water source buffet).

 Since heavy rain was forcasted, I ended up bringing my Solplex, added a rain skirt, and my Apex puffy. I was glad I brought them. They all saw use, especially the puffy since it was 40-50's at night and raining, damp, etc. The rain skirt was nice for in the morning when it rains from the waist down. I think the only items not really needed were my mosquito head net, and my paracord. I ended up just sleeping with my food. I saw very little in terms of wildlife.

Had it been sunny, I would have brought just my tarp, no puffy, no rain skirt.  I was bummed I didn't get a good chance to cowboy camp. Still, it was a fun trip. Would recommend.

Maybe a brief mention of food: I didn't bring a stove, but I had bagels, sharp cheddar, pre cooked bacon, some tuna packets, granola, powdered milk, some bars, peanut m&m's, snickers, dried apple chips, etc.

So yeah, that's my thoughts on it. It was fun, I learned a lot about myself and my need to get back into shape. I would do it again, but hopefully with better weather.

399,1691332894.0,Trip Report: South Dakota Centennial Trail,"**Where:** South Dakota Centennial Trail

**When:** 07/23/2023-07/29/2023 (7 days, 6 nights)

**Distance:**

According to guidebook - 124 miles; + 20,000 ft / - 22,000 ft (NOBO)

According to my watch (with some bonus excursions) - 131.65 miles; + 18,963 ft / - 20,162 ft

**Conditions:** 90+ F and sunny during the day, mid 50s/lower 60s at night. A couple of pop-up thunderstorms at night. The trail ranges from matted-down grass single track to wide open two track that is shared with ATVs.

**Lighterpack:** [https://lighterpack.com/r/wy4g26](https://lighterpack.com/r/wy4g26)

**Useful Pre-Trip Info:**

**Overview** \- The South Dakota Centennial Trail was commissioned in 1989 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of South Dakota’s statehood. Trail brochure: [https://gfp.sd.gov/userdocs/centennial-trail-brochure.pdf](https://gfp.sd.gov/userdocs/centennial-trail-brochure.pdf)

**Shuttle** \- We used Roam’n Around to get from Rapid City to the southern trailhead and back from the northern trailhead. Jon is the man; he gave us a breakdown of the water situation along the trail on the way there and treated us with ice cold waters on the way back! The Roam’n Around shop is a full-fledged outdoor store where you could buy anything you needed pre-trip that you may have forgotten. They also print certificates for people that finish the trial, as there is currently no official group governing the trail. They will even cache water or food resupply for you, for a fee. The total round-trip cost for me and my two hiking buddies was $190, about $63 per person. [https://www.roamnaround.com/shuttle.html](https://www.roamnaround.com/shuttle.html)

**Resupply** \- We shipped boxes to ourselves at the Whispering Springs Campground General Store. As of this writing the hours are 8 AM to 8 PM, and they have some snacks and drinks available as well. There is NOT enough food there to do a full resupply only at the General Store.

The General Store was a great oasis on a trail that is devoid of typical thru-hiking trail magic. They had some frozen foods that they sold cooked, so we ordered some Jack’s pizzas for lunch. They also sold beer, let us charge our devices, and let us fill up water. Overall, it was a good morale boost as our only stop in civilization on the 7 day journey.

**Water** \- An important resource in staying alive, water is not always readily available on the SDCT. One section in particular is a possible 24 mile dry stretch if Elk Creek is dry. Elk Creek is very unreliable, and may be very high and difficult to cross or completely dry. Luckily, a couple of weeks of nighttime thunderstorms before our hike filled the creeks up, so it was not a big concern on our hike.

The main resource I used for water planning is the Hiking Centennial Trail book. The guidebook is written from a section hiking perspective, but I found it useful for planning on where to stop for water. There is a table in the back of the book that lists the water sources along the trail as well as their reliability.

Another useful resource is the Hiking Centennial Trail Facebook group. People will sometimes post updates on the current status of creeks, particularly Elk Creek. Within the FB group there are also links to other useful pages and resources for the trial.

**FB Group:** [https://www.facebook.com/sdcentennialtrail](https://www.facebook.com/sdcentennialtrail)

**Navigation** \- This trail is a bit difficult to follow or poorly marked in some places. A few times we found ourselves missing a turn and needing to double back. I would strongly recommend using some type of GPS map on your phone. I purchased the map made by the guidebook writers and used it in the Avenza app. It worked well, and if you are on the trail and don’t see a blaze for 100 yards or so, you should check your map to make sure you didn’t miss a turn. [https://www.paypal.com/instantcommerce/checkout/RN75QF9QNZEKS](https://www.paypal.com/instantcommerce/checkout/RN75QF9QNZEKS)

**Campsites** \- The Centennial Trail passes through Wind Cave National Park, Custer State Park, Black Hills National Forest and Black Elk Wilderness, Fort Meade BLM, and Bear Butte State Park, each with their own camping regulations. Most of the trail goes through the National Forest and Wilderness, which allows dispersed camping. There is not a lot of traffic on this trail, so there are not really any previously impacted spots or clear areas to camp in the national forest. Whether traveling SOBO or NOBO, it is likely optimal to stay at French Creek Natural Area (only legal backcountry site in the first \~28 miles NOBO) and Alkali Creek Trailhead (only legal campsite in the last \~15 miles NOBO). I’ll discuss campsites more in the report itself.

**The Report:**

I will include the distance covered on trail according to the map as well as the distance/elevation according to my Coros Apex GPS watch. I measured campsite-to-campsite for “real” walking numbers to include off-trail excursions, planned and unplanned.

**Day 1, Norbeck Trailhead to French Creek Natural Area, 16 miles on trail**

*Measured: 17.35 miles, + 2329 ft / - 2054 ft*

Jon picked us up from our Airbnb around 6:30 AM, landing us at the Norbeck TH in Wind Cave National Park around 7:45. We saw some bison along the road as we neared the trailhead, which we took as a good sign since we would be less likely to encounter them on the trail. Jon took our picture for the Roam’n Around Wall of Fame, and we were off! The singletrack was largely overgrown, mostly with poison ivy. With the high temperatures we had planned to hike in shorts the entire time, so we decided our best option was to push forward, cross our fingers, and rinse the oils off our legs when we could. After a quick 6 miles we went through the gate to get into Custer State Park. A fellow hiker was at the trailhead waiting to be picked up, calling it quits because it was too hot. We popped up our umbrellas, filled up on water, and carried on through the open fields. A prairie dog colony protested our presence as the trail led directly through the middle of their territory. We were also blessed to see a pronghorn racing through a small valley, although we weren’t quick enough with our cameras to capture it. A handful of sweaty miles through rolling hills later we arrived at the French Creek Horse Camp, where accommodating campsite hosts typically allow weary hikers to stay for free. We elected to carry on a 1 ⁄ 2 mile further and a 1 ⁄ 2 mile off the trail to the backcountry site in the French Creek Natural Area. We were rewarded with some quiet to pull the ticks off ourselves (I found 3 on me over the course of the day) and a cool creek to rinse our legs off. Luckily, no one had any reaction to the poison ivy, but our legs were still a little itchy/sore from the other plants and long grass that were encroaching the trail.

**Day 2, French Creek Natural Area to Pine Creek, 20.1 miles on trail**

*Measured: 21.04 miles, + 3632 ft / - 3127 ft*

The second day on trail was more overgrown singletrack through open, exposed fields with some occasional respite in some trees. The air was still most of the day, so we made good use of our umbrellas to try to keep our bodies at a reasonable temperature. A good portion of the miles also covered two-track, and in some places the trail looked like some dude drove through a field with his pickup truck and just stuck some signs in the ground whenever he felt like it. At one point, we took a wrong turn by literally following a blaze/sign. Our best guess was that the sign was knocked down and put back in a wrong spot or someone just decided to mess with hikers. We even found the little pile of support rocks where we assumed the sign was supposed to go, so we put the sign back, murmured a curse on whoever moved the sign, and continued on. Winding further into the hills, surrounded by natural outcroppings, we made it to an overlook where you can see Mount Rushmore from the trail, or at least 2 of the 4 faces. We elected not to take the spur trail to Mount Rushmore because we didn’t want to. Unfortunately, we were passed by a dozen horses and thus dodged fresh horse droppings on the trail the rest of the way to Pine Creek, where we set up camp up in the nearby cliffs. A thunderstorm rolled through that night with some light rain and pretty strong winds, but it was no match for my (admittedly poorly pitched) SMD Lunar Solo.

**Day 3, Pine Creek to Victoria Creek, 19.9 miles on trail**

*Measured: 20.30 miles, + 3488 ft / - 3819 ft*

We were blessed with some clouds as well as more tree coverage as we stumbled along the horse trail they let people walk on sometimes. In some places the trail is a knee-deep trench from all the horse traffic. After an initial descent, a continuous climb brought us to the highest point on the trail, just above 5800 ft. We paused for a brief moment to appreciate the view and started the descent down to Sheridan Lake. We took our lunch break at the Flume Trailhead near the boat launch for the lake. In hindsight, it would have been better to keep going another \~0.75 miles along the extremely cruisy lakeside trail to a shady beach spot, where we could have enjoyed an early afternoon dip to cool off. Instead, we walked across the top of the dam and joined some cliff-jumpers on the north side of the lake near a bridge for a quick splash. A couple miles later the trail quickly changed terrain from rocky with pine trees back to open, rolling hills. The trail was once again basically matted down grass and was a bit tricky to follow. A large herd of cows greeted us at where we had planned to camp, near the cattle trough around mile 54 marked as an “always reliable” water source in the guidebook. The nearby rocky cliffs did not look promising, so we continued a couple of miles further to Victoria Creek, which was not labeled a water source on the map, but it was flowing. Near Victoria Creek, there was a good looking section of pines up a short hill where we found space to camp.

**Day 4, Victoria Creek to Pilot Knob Trailhead, 15 miles on trail**

*Measured: 16.62 miles, + 2362 ft  / - 2445 ft*

Day 4 started with much of the same scenery we had encountered on the first few days. Near Rapid Creek we had to basically bushwhack through some baby willows to follow the trail. At one of the Rapid Creek crossings we ran into the only other thru-hiker we met on the entire trail, Gopher, and her trusty four-legged companion, Finley. We chatted for a bit, refilled water, gave Finley some pets (he was a very good boy), and continued on. We passed Pactola Reservoir with barely a glance at the water because we had one thing on our mind: resupply and refuel at the Whispering Pines General Store. We paused briefly to take a picture of a disco ball hanging over the trail near someone’s cabin. Around mile 67.2 we crossed the road going down to the General Store and campground. Another option would have been to take the Deer Creek Trailhead trail about 0.2 further along the trail, which ends up taking the same road to the store. As I discussed in the “Resupply” section above, we shipped food boxes to ourselves at the store. We kicked our shoes off, grabbed some beer, snacks, and a couple of frozen pizzas. The campground owners are quite friendly to thru hikers, and they let us hang out inside the store despite our 3.5-day stench. The campground has a small pool, pay showers, and even some cabins, so it could be a good spot to properly rest up. Gopher and Finley showed up near the end of our rest time, so we gave Finley a couple more pets (still a good boy) on our way back to the trail. We carried on a few miles to Jim Creek Pilot Knob Trailhead. There is no camping allowed at the trailhead, so we hiked a short distance up the trail to find another spot up on a hill amongst some pines. We were near enough to the trailhead to take advantage of the picnic table for dinner and the pit toilet after our morning coffee. Although we were close enough to a road to hear the occasional car buzzing by, this campsite did grant us the best sunset views of the week.

**Day 5, Pilot Knob Trailhead to Dalton Lake Campground, 14.8 miles on trail**

*Measured: 15.00 miles, +1647 ft / - 2293 ft*

Jokingly referred to as our “rest day,” the trail was relatively easy two-track during this section. Unfortunately, it is an easy two-track because this segment is also open to off-road vehicles. We had to make way for a handful of ATVs, side-by-sides, and dirt bikes along the way. Other than some awesome rock walls and one scenic overlook, there wasn’t much else of note on this section. We arrived at Dalton Lake Campground in the early afternoon and selected an open spot on the far end. There are 11 campsites in the campground, with one occupied by the campground host. Each site has a large picnic table and a fire ring. After paying the $21.50 fee, we hung out by the “lake” (it’s definitely a pond or swimming hole) and generally relaxed to rest up for the biggest day of the hike waiting for us in the morning. Gopher and Finley rolled into the campground as well; we purchased some firewood from the campground host and shared hiking stories around the fire with them before heading to bed early.

**Day 6, Dalton Lake Campground to Alkali Creek Campground, 24 miles on trail**

*Measured: 24.81 miles, + 3035 ft / - 3835 ft*

The first morning dew of the trip added some water weight to our tents as we strolled out of the silent campground before everyone was awake. Across the creek we were met with a gradual incline through a tunnel of pine trees. The trail in this section was well groomed and fostered a solid hiking pace. After climbing up we walked directly back down on a gradual decline to Elk Creek. Once again, we were quite lucky to have water flowing in Elk Creek at this time of year. We broke for lunch, filled up on water, and chatted with a couple of local mountain bikers that were coming through. The second half of the day was quite similar to the first half - a long gradual incline surrounded by pines with a break through the trees here and there to view the surrounding hills, followed by a slow decline back down to Alkali Creek. The last mile or so is out in the open again, surrounded by purple wildflowers (spotted knapweed or maybe thistle). After passing under a railroad bridge and a highway, the Alkali Creek campground was a welcome sight. The campground has potable water, pit toilets, and a $6 overnight fee. This night was the only night on trail where we experienced bug pressure that warranted some bug spray, likely due to the virtually stagnant Alkali Creek.

A couple notes on camping at Alkali Creek. According to the BLM website, there are 6 camping spots. When we arrived and took a look around to find a spot, there were 26 spots. Under normal circumstances I wouldn’t worry about this campground filling up; however, it is closed during Sturgis Bike Week (don’t get me started), which is usually in the beginning of August, so keep that in mind during your planning.

**Day 7, Alkali Creek Campground to Bear Butte, 14.1 miles on trail**

*Measured: 16.53 miles, + 2470 ft / - 2589 ft*

Our last day we hit the trail hot. We could see Bear Butte from the road out of the campground, calling us to complete our journey. The trail wound up and over one last hill into the wide open plains that cover much of South Dakota. A lot of the signs were knocked down in this area, either from strong winds blowing over the plains or from the free roaming cattle in the area. We once again missed a turn and had to double back. Cruising past Bear Butte Lake and up to the Bear Butte Education Center, we took a short rest and chatted with Mike, a Native American working at the center, about our hike and the significance of Bear Butte to the indigenous people in the area. We stored our backpacks in the education center, keeping only our phones, trekking poles, and a single water bottle to share. Free of our packs and so close to the end, we flew up the \~1.5 mile rocky trail to the top. Multi colored cloths streamed from trees, placed by indigenous people offering prayers. The state park is close to a highway, so there were a number of other people climbing the mountain to view the surrounding landscape. In some ways, it was a bit shocking to run into multiple day hikers after encountering so few people along 120+miles on the trail. After soaking in the 360-degree views of the Black Hills and open prairies from the top, we returned to the education center, where Jon from Roam’n Around picked us up and brought us back to Rapid City.

**Gear Notes:**

Almost all my gear was battle-tested last year on Vermont’s very own Long Trail, so I don’t have a ton of fresh thoughts on my gear list. My main thought regarding gear is that I definitely could have taken less - no puffy, smaller powerbank, probably even no raincoat. I could have lived without pants, although it would have been a little chilly getting ready on a couple mornings. With no experience in this climate and relatively little information about the trail available, I definitely packed my fears.

**SMD Silver Shadow** \- The umbrella was critical the first couple days of this trail. Miles through exposed hills with little to no wind in 90+ F heat would have been close to literal hell without this thing. However, the SMD umbrella attachment system is garbage and I wish I would have bought the Gossamer Gear attachment kit instead. My two hiking buddies had the GG attachment kit and had a much easier time dialing in the umbrella to a useful and comfortable position.

**Red Paw Packs Flex Fanny Pack** \- This little guy works great as a ditty, particularly because my glasses case (a Crystal Light canister) fits perfectly in the stretch part on top. I put my phone, my poop kit (never leaving this thing behind again, ever), and a 500mL Smartwater bottle in it to summit Bear Butte, so it doubles as a baby day pack. The quality of this thing is fantastic and Matt was great to work with when I was picking out a fabric for it.

Powerbank - I could have taken a smaller one along, but I wasn’t sure how long we would want to hang out at the General Store. We could have planned a little better pre-trip to stay at the general store and charge up.",Ultralight

It has no features that make it suitable for backpacking. The shoulder straps are two pieces of 1"" polypropylene webbing. The side pockets are too narrow to fit a smart water bottle. I honestly don't really know what you are supposed to use them for. I got a battery in one.

Naturally, I wanted to use one to show all of my friends how cool and minimalist I am. Three days was about the maximum amount of time I could get away from work, which wasn't too bad considering I was almost out of candy and cake frosting by the end of the third day, and upon leaving, my pack was filled to the rim (like brim).

A longer trip would likely require taping food directly to your body, which I seriously considering before leaving.

Overall, it worked pretty well. The shoulder straps got uncomfortable after a while, but not terribly so. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but it could have been much worse.

Previously, I've use GG The Two to backpack with a buddy but don't love it enough to get The One. Searching around the X-mid has caught my eye but I'm torn between the regular and pro versions. It's basically a question of whether I can justify the extra cost of the pro to myself - here's what I see as the pros or the pro:

 - ~10 oz weight savings
 - single-hand zipper usability for inner
 - gear pockets at mid-level instead of at peaks
 - more internal space

While the disadvantages:

 - single-wall, although the peak vents make me optimistic about condensation
 - DCF longevity - debating attempting a thru of the AT next year and would want something that can handle that
 - cost obviously


Can any x-mid owners of either type weight in here with either things I missed or their own thoughts?

421,1691028464.0,Experience with Finetrack's Elemental Layer,"Second-time poster here. This is a bit of a late follow-up post, but it’s summertime and I was reflecting on the highlights of the last year, which for me was my ski trip to Niseko with a group of friends. So please stay with me when I digress a bit at the beginning for context! Feel free to skip this part if you would only like to read about my experience with Finetrack:

\*\*\*\*\*Our booking got rolled over twice (T.T) because of COVID, and we were finally able to go on this long-awaited trip. We had to take the bus up from Sapporo to get to Niseko, but we landed smack in the middle of a snowstorm. We heard of quite a few accidents on the road the day before, and honestly, we weren’t even sure if we were going to make it there as we had to fly from Tokyo to Sapporo that morning. We originally booked a car for our journey, but because of the snowstorm we decided to play it safe and forfeited our booking and ended up taking the bus up. I slept like a log throughout the entire bus ride (yep, I’m the worst road trip buddy), but here is a [video](https://imgur.com/a/ZYj1QBz) from my friend.

Thank God we didn’t drive up and we made it to Niseko in one piece. The snowstorm actually cleared up just in time, and gave us lovely fresh powdery [snow](https://imgur.com/a/hGOC4Y3) every day!

\*\*\*\*\*Okay - back to the topic - I did ask this sub for advice on layering for this and you guys told me to prioritize a moisture-wicking base layer. The brands that got the most mentions were Finetrack, Rohan, and Brynje.I did read up on these brands and while there are certainly advantages to all of them, I ended up choosing finetrack because their [flagship store](https://imgur.com/a/1SrD25H) is in Omotesandō, which is a very trendy shopping area I was heading to anyway. The store looked really cool, but I am not going to lie, the in-store experience was not the best, mainly because I do not speak Japanese and the staff did not speak English, so there was a lot of exchanging phones to check translations and I felt I was getting on their nerves a bit.

So, in the past, I've been using the typical 3-layer system with a down jacket/fleece as my inner layer for skiing and hiking and I probably shouldn’t admit this but most of my base layer gear is from Uniqlo, and I have one Columbia omni-heat base layer. Finetrack is purely technical, and you would never find me wearing the elemental layer for aesthetic reasons.This Finetrack mesh shirt is skin-tight but easy to wear. You seriously wouldn’t know from looking at this very thin black mesh construct that it actually has a lot of features. I will spare you all the lingo, but the idea is to have a moisture-wicking elemental layer under the base layer (super important as I made a mistake on this), so that the sweat is transported quicker away from your body. The fabric has a water-repellent finish which, so the theory, manages moisture, keeping you dry and comfortable even during intense physical activities. By preventing the accumulation of moisture, it ensures superior insulation, shielding you from the cold (and reducing the risk of hypothermia).

Now all of that sounds great, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. So here is my experience:I bought the Finetrack long-sleeve elemental layer (Warm) to try it out. On the first day, I wore the elemental layer, a fleece layer, and my ski jacket. The temperature at the top of the mountains was as low as -15°C (5°F) at certain times, and probably around +5°C (41°F) at the bottom of the mountains. However, I actually did feel a bit of the moisture accumulating and wind chills while I was at the top when I was doing runs. I was pretty disappointed until I went back to the online reviews and website, and I realized that I needed to wear ANOTHER base layer on top of the elemental layer - so the elemental layer was like Layer 0 for me.

So I tried it again, this time with the extra Columbia omni-heat layer on top of the elemental layer. On the second day, it actually was a little colder as we did night skiing as well, and at the top of the mountains, the temperature went as low as -18°C (-0.5°F).  Thankfully, the combination was much more comfortable and it regulated my temperature surprisingly well. I didn’t feel uncomfortable even when there were occasional strong winds (and poor visibility) as it was able to retain the heat. Usually, when I feel worn out from the runs, I would typically be sweaty and cold at the same time (and I would zip my ski jacket up and down), but that didn’t happen with the extra elemental layer.

I washed the elemental layer and only used the Omni-heat layer the next day to see if I could feel the difference, and I must say that the moisture-wicking feature really helps. I didn’t realize it could make that much of a difference in such a wide temperature range - able to keep you warm when it’s cold and prevent you from feeling your sweat when you are doing the intense runs.The only thing about the elemental layer is that it needs to be skin-tight in order to be effective, so it is not flattering (at all) and you can feel the mesh against your skin. Of course, it’s all hidden so no one sees it, but I prefer looser clothing, so that took a bit of getting used to.Overall, the Elemental Layer system kept me warm and regulated my body temperature much better than my old approach. I'm looking forward to test this combo under even colder and warmer conditions and may try out their base layers as well.So all in all, I can highly recommend giving this a shot. Thanks for all your help with this one, I have learned a lot!",Ultralight

423,1691014040.0,Looking for (ultralight) soft flasks that work with Sawyer/Quickdraw or suggestions for alternative water system,"So am transitioning to carrying my water in shoulder pockets instead of side pockets and have searched all over for something with a 28mm opening that has plastic hard enough that it will actually work with a Quickdraw or Squeeze and also isn't super heavy. I realize basically anything is going to be a weight penalty relative to my smartwater bottles but I find them uncomfortable in my shoulder pockets. Thought I had finally found something that would work (Salomon 500ml 28mm soft flask), but the threads are either too soft or not exactly 28mm, tried both my Quickdraw and my Squeeze and neither worked.

Open to other systems as well but the common filters for fastpacking/trail running (BeFree and the Hydrapak filter cap)  seem a lot less robust than my Quickdraw. I rarely have to filter silty water but I also don't want something that I'm going to have to replace/mess around with all the time. Have had a Quickdraw since shortly after they came out and love them, super durable, flow rate stays great, easy to clean, has field test for integrity for when I get too high and forget to bring the filter into my bag at night. Basically checks all the boxes so would love to continue using it. I realize the profile is going to be bulkier/longer than a BeFree type filter but figured I'd just use a bit of shock cord on my shoulder strap to keep it from flopping around too much.

I considered the CNOV Vesica 28mm but my concern there is that 1L is just way too much volume for most of my shoulder pockets. But I've also never used one, maybe they collapse neatly so that it's not too much of a problem to just fill it up with 500-600ml at a time.

Based in Utah so most of my trips are going to be in the Uintas, Winds, Sawtooths and a bit in the desert once it cools down in the fall. Every trip so far I've been surprised how heavy my pack has been even as I've tried to cut back on things, usually comes to around 30lbs with food/water for 1-2 nights which is a lot. Ideally I'd like to get my baseweight down < 15 pounds.

I've been interested in the idea of ultralight for awhile, being able to cover large distances without the weight of heavy pack to slow you down. I'm pretty good on fitness and able to do 20 miles day hikes without issue. I think the biggest reduction in weight I can do right now is a new tent as my current weighs over 6 pounds and is by far the heaviest item in my pack. Probably going to swap it out with a Durtston X-Mid 1p as I could save about 4 pounds there even with adding in the trekking poles. I'm willing to spend a few hundred this season to reduce my weight, but not much more at the moment. Any feedback is appreciated!

Worked well, do expect a bit of a puff of gas on release which is a bit scary. But as long as you have a level surface it doesn't leak at all while filling.

429,1690984125.0,Kungsleden Shakedown (and tips welcome) - Late August,"Hey everyone,

in 3 weeks, I'm embarking on a 10-day hike along the Northern Kungsleden. As I finalize my gear list, I'd love to get your input on my choices. My main area of concern right now is if my layering system works in all possible weather conditions, since I have no experience with the climate in Northern Sweden. 

Some of the questions I'm currently evaluating are:

- Mid layer choice good and versatile enough?
- Skip the Storm Cruiser and bring a wind jacket (Tachyon) + a lighter rain jacket (Versalite) for versatility?
- Should I consider a sun hoodie (e.g. Montbell Merino Light Hoodie)?
- Recommendation for lighter, bug proof, ventilated pants?
- Pillow: yes/no?

So basically everything but the yellow starred items in my lighterpack are up for debate, although I have a limited budget for upgrades (max. €1500).

- **Location/temp range/specific trip description:** Kungsleden, Sweden from Kvikkjokk to Abisko, end of August, 20°C - -5°C
- **Goal Baseweight (BPW):** anything sub 6kg would be awesome
- **Budget:** max. € 1500 for upgrades
- **Non-negotiable Items:** yellow starred items in the lighterpack
- **Solo or with another person?:** Solo
- **Additonal Infos:** I'm aware I could save weight with a smaller sleeping pad, but I'm a very active sleeper and this size is proven to work well for me.

431,1690968690.0,"Damp down quilt advice,first time down product owner.","Sorry for the long intro,the question is a bit below. 

Hi, I'm new to UL so this is my first time owning a down product. I wanted to get a UL summer sleeping bag and i decided to get the Cumulus Quilt 250. 
And i really loved it. 
That is until it rained. 
Two nights ago i was in my tent(Xmid 1 solid) and it started raining,first time camping in the rain. And it wasn't too bad. The tent did the job perfectly and due to the winds there was actually very little condensation. 
I was actually really happy with this experience as i was worried how things were going to work out in the rain. 
I was happy until it came time to pack up my quilt. 
Unfortunately i had to leave very early in order to catch a bus i needed. 
When i started to pack my quilt i noticed it didn't offer nearly as much resistance to packing as it normally would. 
It was not soaked or anything. It was perhaps a bit damp where i was breathing (i tried to avoid breathing into it,but it just happened during the night) but nothing too bad. I checked the rest of it,there wasn't water anywhere, nothing was soaked,just a bit ""damp""but again not too much,all of it was like that,i assume it was moisture from the air and not the condensation. 
I was very worried as i was packing but i just had to go with it like that. 
I then forgot about it during the day. 
It was when i started setting up that i remembered this. 
It was lofting up so painfully slow. I was really worried. Somehow it did loft up,i made it through the night and dried it in the sun the next day. 
It seems to be fine now,other than the footbox,but it seems to me in general as if though there is a bit less down there,even from before. 

So my question is,how do you guys handle this on long distance thru hikes? What do i do when it's raining couple days in a row and i just can't dry it out? Like, it's just not always possible. It's also a little annoying when i just want to get going that that's it,like the tent i can pack away when it's wet,but not the bag. 

Should i get a bigger dry bag for when it's wet so that i would not compress it as much? This is my plan anyways so that it would loft up faster. 
I was so frustrated by this,i wanted to sell it right away and get something synthetic. (You know,just the thoughts you get in situations like that). 
Would hydrophobic down make any difference? 
The thing i like about down is not just the pack size,but how it warms me up instantly,you just can't get that with synthetics unfortunately. 
I really like my down,please help with your advice.",Ultralight

433,1690922568.0,Opinions on pillows,"This might not be the right subreddit for this as pillows are probably a luxury item for backpacking.  For years I was ‘team clothes in a stuff sack’.  Then I started experimenting with pillows.  And I do sleep better, though I find myself looking for the perfect pillow.  Which I have yet to find.

So for the pillow folk out there, what pillow would you recommend?  

So far I have tried:

- Outdoor vitals (3oz) - This is really their fault and the pushing the pillow on me with YouTube ads.  But I am fond of it and it is my current default.  The fill nozzle (?) is great.  I can blow it up with 1-2 breaths and really easy to let out just a little air.
- Therm-a-Rest airhead lite (2oz) -  second pillow purchased.  I do not care for this pillow.  And neither does anyone else in the family.  My partner currently uses it as a leg pillow.  Nozzle is typical Therm-a-Rest 
- Nemo Fillo elite (3oz) -  it’s about the same as the OV one comfort wise.  I tried it on one trip.  My kid uses it.  I don’t really trust the durability as the air bag (I guess) is just a thin, clear plastic bag.  Nozzle is lightly better than the Therm-a-Rest but not as good as the OV.
- Klymit XL (3.2 oz) - I have actually not tried this yet.  My other kid uses it.  I hammock and it seems too big for a hammock.  It was an impulse buy as it was in the outdoor section in a department store of sorts (Bi-mart fwiw).
- Therm-a-Rest compressible(7oz) - probably the best comfort wise.  Maybe.  But 3oz is already a ‘splurge’ and 7oz is pushing it.  It is not 7oz nice.

I am still looking for something better. 

 I checked out feathered friends but it looks like you need an air pillow to make it work.

Sea to summit makes some, but their offering looks underwhelming comfort wise.

436,1690899258.0,High passes and traverse - Observations on snow gear,"Pics [https://imgur.com/a/weX5LrZ](https://imgur.com/a/weX5LrZ)

Receiving crucial route beta from an internet friend got this thing rolling in mid-July. We had five alpine passes without trails to cross, in a range notorious for difficult going.

Being semi-local to the area we were able to gauge the snow levels via Sentinel pretty accurately - spikes and axes for sure. Even without night frost once July rolls around the old remaining snow usually provides an ideal surface for quick passage most of the day. And, as was the case here, it was plentiful and covered hours of otherwise tedious talus. The dreaded sun cups, slowing snow travel to a painful crawl in the Sierra, is thankfully not really a continental feature.

Our group grew bigger than usual and diverging schedules left us with three days. It was just enough to cover 35 miles, as the bulk of it was my kind going: one-mile-an-hour with full attention turned on.

Gear notes:

Trail runners... After a couple hundred miles the soles are predictably slicker on snow than my shop Crocs; effective side hilling and somewhat precise scrambling is a distant memory from the approach shoe days; the midsole, an overcooked slab of lasagna, is downright painful on talus. And not to forget the teaspoon of glacial dirt scooping in thru numerous tears every step. But, alas, aging feet with bunions and tendon issues need the generous fore-foot room.

Combining such out of place footwear with micro spikes and heading out on steep, firm snow requires that addictive danger-concentration mindset. These passes were not Forester style follow-the-trench, but rather sweeps of smooth unbroken slopes nearing 45°.

The nature of snow deposits, wind, and terrain features makes just about every snow and ice slope in the backcountry an ever-steepening affair. Sometimes to the point of having an overhanging cornice at the top. This nearly imperceptible increase in consequence can bring beginners unknowingly into trouble.

The more experienced led the pack and kicked steps as good as possible before toe pain relegated everybody to French technique. The downhills are no less stressful but does take you towards lower angled terrain at every step; and selecting lines with a relatively safe run-out should one slip is an important safety aspect. Ie, slopes going steep directly into a talus field is high danger.

We had two pairs of Kahtoola Microspikes, one set of similar Chainsen, and two Kahtoola Trail Crampons. The Microspikes harness is the most secure, but the spikes are the shortest - too little reach for this kind of stuff.

The Chainsen have slightly more aggressive points, aka safer, but the front chains are spaced too far apart so the shoe punches thru when kicking steps. This leaves you without spikes under the forefoot: a bad scenario.

The Trail Crampons were the old red aluminum ones, veterans of many hard trips. While they bite really well in all conditions the harness is the least secure of all, and takes skill to attach correctly. On the size 13 shoes they came completely off now and then, while on the size 7 the heel slipped side ways with alarming frequency. Possibly the current version is better designed although looking at the pics it seems not. Soft shoes are to blame here, but that’s what they are meant for.

So adventure footwear and associated snow traction devices are, imo, a mixed bag which needs to be combined with a healthy dose of experience and/or guiding, to approach a comfortable level of safety.

For the handheld tools we had two TiCa’s, two Whippets, and an 80’s era ice axe. The two pound axe obv performed best but the lightweights were not far behind. The gear industry got us covered here. Which is good because these are the seat belts of snow ‘hiking’: should a slip occur due to floppy shoes and insecure spikes quick reactions with the ice axe is what saves the day.

Shoutout to the reliability, livability and overall quality of Yama tents. We had a Swiftline and a 2 person Cirriform, both participants of numerous trips. While the mild conditions hardly would have challenged any make or model, these two stand out in the crowded field of UL shelters.",Ultralight

Sierra Summer Lighterpack: [https://lighterpack.com/r/jb590n](https://lighterpack.com/r/jb590n)

Having now put a reasonable number of nights on this pack, I thought I'd review it. Nobody else has done a proper review of the Hybrid on here, so I feel like its a worthwhile exercise.

I purchased the M/L 45L version of this pack in February and have used it for a total of 25 nights.  Not a great deal of time compared to a thru hiker or whatever, but long enough to know whether or not I like it. u/Nunatak16 was very helpful with my questions leading up to the purchase regarding sizing and whether it was an appropriate pack for my use case. The 45L has an internal capacity of around 38L once a can has been installed and is constructed of Ultragrid, Gridstop, Robic and the bottom area of the pack is Ultra TX. It weighs 1070 grams. I also ordered a hip belt pocket, a bottle pocket and at a later time I ordered two shoulder pockets. All add-ons are expertly constructed, as is the pack. The shoulder pockets are some of the best I've used. No stretchy fabrics and they just open and close, one handed, two handed, you name it.

I purchased the pack with the intention of spending a lot of time in the Sierra this year, and then the rain and snow came, so the usage in the Sierra has been limited to 6 nights/7 days, but I have some more trips booked for next month. The rest of the time it has been in Joshua Tree NP and the Angeles and San Bernardino National Forests.

I chose the Hybrid because I wanted a pack that could be used for heavier loads with or without a bear can, that would last for a long time (no laminated fabrics here) while being lighter than a traditional pack. In the winter it can comfortably carry warmer, bulkier clothes, in the peak summer where water is sparse it can haul water, and of course, it can carry a large bear can. My hiking and backpacking partner has type 1 diabetes, so her food and/or insulin being messed around with is an absolute non-negotiable, so even down here in the ANF and SBNF, I carry the can and we share it. No messing about with Ursacks or tree hangs.

Prior to the Hybrid being available, I had ordered a stock pack but cancelled my order within a few minutes - I am very indecisive. The pack's designer asked me why I cancelled and I told them that I  purchased a Bears Ears. The designer was very skeptical of carrying a bear can on the hip belt and that low down, but not me. I am totally sold on carrying a can on one's hip belt. The design of the harness, combined with the floating hipbelt means I completely forget that it's there, my center of gravity still feels very natural and its just as comfy as carrying the pack without the bear can.

The weight transfer of the pack is very good. This was my first framed, hip belted, load lifting pack, so I did have to ask Jan for some advice on optimising the fit. Initially I was pretty underwhelmed by the comfort level, but after receiving his response and taking his advice... man.... this pack fits like a dream. The shoulder straps are thick and cushy, the hip belt too, and the stays and 1/8"" inch foam pad in the back of pack stop you from feeling the contents of the pack entirely.

I think I have two favorite things about this pack: the front pocket is HUGE. I only really put my quilt, clothing, sleeping pad and pillow inside of the pack. I put almost everything else on the outside in the large mesh pocket. I do still have to take the pack off to gain access to the contents of the outside pocket but that's no big deal.

My second favourite thing is how much you *don't* have to baby this pack. Once the can is out, the bottom of the pack and the hip belt are susceptible to abrasion and damage and getting knocked about but you wouldn't know it from looking at my pack. It still looks borderline new and to be honest, I treat it like shit.

Oh - the bottle holster. I initially did not like this at all, in fact I hated it. Until I moved it further around the hip belt and closer to my back. It was much better then and its now one of my favourite things about the pack. I've used it with a 1L Smartwater bottle with a sports cap and also with a Platypus Quickdraw attached to the bottle - no issues at all - it doesn't get in the way and I do not accidentally strike it with my elbow.

But it can't all be sunshine and rainbows, right? Well, no. Honestly, I should've just bought a framed Bears Ears. I don't envisage myself using the pack without a bear can very frequently, if ever, and if I'm not carrying a bear can, I can probably just use my Cutaway. With that said, its nice to still have the flexibility of *not* carrying a can and having a 45L pack. One thing to note is that the can carrying harness is the same on both packs, but the framed Bears Ears has a dedicated curve for the bear can, whereas the Hybrid has some fabric that needs to be folded into the pack. It seems incredibly resilient but this is a *potential* failure point that does not exist on a standard framed Bears Ears - emphasis on the potential - because it seems as though it'll be totally fine.

&#x200B;

Edit: Something else I meant to mention is that, while the pack sits directly on your back with no airflow, the contact point with your back is quite narrow versus some other packs, so it still feels like there is some air getting to the extreme left and right sides of your back. Not sure how much that makes sense, but essentially, for a larger pack, its surprisingly not that sweaty. I have, and do, get bacne from some other packs, but not this one.

441,1690861069.0,Trip Report: 8 Days/7 Nights in Colorado's Weminuche Wilderness,"Hello All,

Just got back from a lovely backpacking trip in the Weminuche Wilderness. I saw that someone else recently took a trip there and was likewise impressed. I'm an UL-er by necessity, being very smol, but I don't go too extreme, so judge my gear list liberally. I'm always shaving things down as I have the money to upgrade things, but it's a work in progress. This was my second trip to the Weminuche, and it reaffirmed my opinion that it is punishing yet stunning. But hopefully this will encourage y'all to get out there.

**Where:** Weminuche Wilderness, Colorado - Highland Mary Lakes trailhead to Mt. Leviathan and back via the CDT/CT

**When:** July 22-29, 2023

**Distance:** \~ 28 miles; Elevation change of +9000 feet

**Conditions:** Lows 50s, Highs 70s-80s; Afternoon clouds and thunderstorms

**The Report:** Originally we were planning to do another trip that we'd found on CalTopo that went from the Highland Mary Lakes trailhead all the way down to Endlich Mesa outside Durango. Having previously done some travel around Vestal Basin, we were curious to know what things were like on the other side. This was always meant to be a trip to push ourselves, as it involved a lot of cross country navigation. We trained and travelled to elevation in the weeks beforehand and scheduled a few recovery days throughout. Even still, we realized about halfway in that we simply weren't making the miles we needed to. We expected there to be some social trails, but there really weren't, and parts were a straight-up slog. In the end, we turned around and took a different route back to the trailhead.

*Day 1:* 6ish miles, 2,100 ft. gain

We camped at the trailhead the night before and got an early start. I saw my first moose at the trailhead, which was very fun, and another one later the first day. The trail up to Highland Mary Lakes is pretty straightforward, and it's also full of day hikers. It's not until you hike through the rolling hills and start to descend a drainage down towards the Colorado Trail that it becomes challenging. It's possible there was a social trail we missed, but following the Gaia track meant that we had to bushwhack all the way down. It was pretty heinous, tbh, and this is why we ended up plotting a different route when we came back. Eventually you hit the CT, and you follow it for a bit until you come to the Elk Creek drainage. We learned coming back at the end of the trip that it's better to skirt the bit of forest there and use the talus. Otherwise it's more crawling over downed trees. There are a few campsites just before treeline, and that's where we ended up on the first day.

*Day 2:* 4ish miles, 2,500 ft. gain

Got up early and crossed the talus up to a large waterfall feature. It looked spooky, but it ended up being easy enough to skirt the falls, and later we realized you can also go up/down a slab to the left. The route continues up to a pass, and the general idea is to avoid having to wade through the willow. At the top, you descend into a wide, gradual valley. We went cross country trying to avoid willow, but it turns out there is a social trail that goes dead center down the valley. It's a little hard to pick up from the top end. Eventually you come to a bit of a prow at the far end of the valley with a few nice campsites. The weather was turning, so we pushed on to try to get to Lake Silex. Our route skips this lake, but we followed a social trail up a cliff before crossing a talus field and cutting steps into a snow bank. We set up our tent just in time for the afternoon storms.

*Day 3:* Rest Day

Had a nice rest day at Lake Silex. It's above treeline and in an amphitheater between Mount Silex and Storm King, so it's very impressive looking. Lots of glaciers and snow banks. We scouted some possible climbs on the mountains for another time. It squalled a bit, but was generally good weather, and we didn't see anyone other than our two local marmots, Sploot and The Bastard. Towards the afternoon, a random elk emerged into the drainage. It must have been sick, because it seemed to just be staggering past and it was panting and alone.

*Day 4:* 3ish miles, 1,200 ft. gain

It's funny to calculate the miles now, because it definitely felt like we were moving farther and more efficiently at altitude by day 4. Most days typically started with a pass, and then some sort of valley, and then another pass, and today was the same. The first pass was between Peak 9 and Storm King, and then you contour along a valley, crossing snow fields and talus to get around the curve of Peak 8 and then Peak 7. It was nice walking until the afternoon, when you have to descend a heinous, unstable talus slope towards Leviathan Lake. We had decided by now that we were going to amend our itinerary, and the weather was turning, so we ended up glisading down a snow field to a small, unnamed lake at the base of the pass to camp. It was a beautiful site---Leviathan Peak really looms over you, and you can see Jagged Peak, which the route would have continued on to.

*Day 5:* 4ish miles, 1,600 ft. gain

We woke up early to tackle the pass in the shade, and definitely moved much more quickly coming back. We made it to the area around Lake Silex within an hour or two and push back up the valley we had come down a few days before. This time we were able to pick up the social trail. It was super humid and hot down near the creek, and we took a side trip up to Trinity Lake for a break. We had waffled on whether to take our second rest day, but ultimately decided that we had the time and that the lake would be a better site for a rest day than what we'd been thinking.

*Day 6:* Rest Day

Oddly, it rained for much of the night and the next day. We spent a lot of time in the tent playing cards and watching the extended LOTR trilogy. Still great!

*Day 7:* 10ish miles, 3,000 ft. gain

Ended up doing a longer day today because of weather. Once we committed to getting up out of the last drainage, we had to get off of the high, open ground. We moved quickly up the valley past Trinity Lake in the morning and got back down over the pass to our first camp site. From there, we cut across the talus to reconnect with the CT further up. It was a hell of a time hiking up to the junction with the CDT. You do pass some cool mining stuff and the scenery changes really dramatically. We joked that we had gone to Patagonia, Mongolia, and Scotland on the trip. At the top of the Elk Creek drainage, you go up a series of switchbacks onto a flat, open ridge, and from there we pushed really quickly to a connector back to the Highland Marie Lakes trail. We ended up camping in a place that was just fine, but low enough to not be at risk of lightning.

*Day 8:* 3ish miles, 500 ft. gain

We hightailed it back to the trailhead, arriving by 10. I didn't note it before, but this is a really beautiful trip for wildflowers in the summer, and they're excellent in this last stretch.

**Gear Notes:**

* Generally happy with what I brought. If anything, my layers were too warm. It was way hotter than we were expecting, especially at night. The weather overall was just odd. The afternoons were toss-ups on whether it would rain or not, which is unusual. It was buggy, but they were only really bad if you stopped moving. I could have used my head net but didn't.;
* It was my first time out with the Pocket Rocket Deluxe after using the Snow Peak GigaPower for years and years. Honestly, I wasn't so impressed with it. It definitely boils faster and it is lighter, but the auto igniter was much more finicky and the canister ejected a lot of fuel when screwing the stove on and off.;
* Also my first time using the Big Agnes Copper Spur. I had the Fly Creek for a long time, and then balked at how much the cost had jumped when it came time to replace it. Fortunately, someone returned a Copper Spur to REI with a single broken clip (easily fixed), and I got it for half price. I love this tent so far, although another clip did break on this trip (also easily fixed, but annoying).;
* This was also my first real test of my Senchi Lark 90. I own several Senchi products and want to like them, but after one night of sleeping in my Lark (not wearing it during the day), it had no less than three holes along various seams. I'm going to email them about it. I don't think I'm particularly careless with my gear, and for $90 it should have held up better.",Ultralight
442,1690854854.0,how do you perfectly pitch the SMD Lunar Solo? (or any trekking pole tent),"Coming back from an extensive trip with the Solo, I still havent figuered out the best method to pitch the damn thing. One night it looks and feels like the roomiest single person tent ever, the next I feel like a toddler trying to get even bathtub walls.

&#x200B;

Usually I pitched the tent in the recommended order of: back -> front left & right -> pole in, front -> back left & right -> retension

&#x200B;

After some experimenting I changed the order to : back left & right -> pole in, front -> front left & right -> back -> retension

This method works way better with getting the bathtub up (still uneven, but better), but when inserting the pole into the o-ring and trying to tension the tent walls properly, the SMD Alu pole (i got the newer solo version) starts to bent - so I either have to decide between putting it into the metal o-ring or pitch it at a slight angle, leading to the front bathtub wall collapsing.

example of slight (can get much worse) bent:

Very greatful for any tips and tricks, like: what best to do on uneven pitch grounds?  Do you recommend to pitch with vestibule closed or open? Pole tilted or straight into o-ring?

Otherwhise  I´m very happy with the Solo, especially since I want to take my (not so ultralight) doggo on my trips in the future.

443,1690842521.0,What trip would be the most different than the mainly California-based trips I've taken so far?,"Hi everyone! I'm looking to plan a backpacking trip in the future to expand my horizons a bit beyond California/the US Southwest. I feel like I'm spoiled a bit here and have mainly stuck to trips within driving distance, but I'd love to spread my wings a bit. I'm looking for something that is visually and ecologically different than what I've experienced before. 

The time period would either be late December/early January or in the summer (June-September). Anything from 3 days to 2 weeks could work. 

I'm open to anywhere in the world as long as traveling there isn't too expensive (ideally under <$2k/person) and would prefer a 3-season trip without snow/very little, but if something is really unique I'd be open to it. I have gone to Rocky Mountain NP during late winter/early spring, so could potentially handle snowy conditions but am also open to looking at guided trips if something looks beyond my abilities.  

Places I've gone hiking, camping, or backpacking: 

* Joshua Tree NP  
* Death Valley NP. 
* Sequoia NP and planning to go to Yosemite NP in the next month   
* San Bernardino National Forest   
* Angeles National Forest 
* Cleveland National Forest 
* Santa Monica Mountains 
* Channel Islands NP (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel Islands) 
* Rocky Mountain NP  
* Grand Canyon NP & Sedona 
* Saguaro NP 
* Petrified Forest NP

Heading out on the Goat Trail in two weeks. 6 days. Some on trail, some off. Lots of scree. Temps likely between 40 and 70, but it's Alaska, so anything is possible--could drop into the 30s, could be windy, rain is likely. Never been to Alaska, and have not done much off trail hiking. So....

How many fears have I packed? :) 

I am going with a group and so will likely be moving slowly and spending more time at camp than normal. So I'm bringing a bit of extra warm layers for camp, as well as camp shoes, assuming I'm ending up with wet feet and hours at camp. Also considering picking up some down booties.

Am I overdoing it?

And I'm weighing the following footwear options: 

Option 1: Topo Ultraventure (no rock plate) -- my usual

Option 2: Topo Trailventure WP Mids (rock plate, waterproof) -- after spending hours on scree last week in WA, a rock plate seems like a banner idea. No sure about the WP though -- my feet are probably going to be wet one way or the other.

Thanks for taking a look!

446,1690826442.0,durability and reliability of ultralight sleeping pads and why influencer videos are useless,"While searching for sleeping mat tests, I noticed that almost all posts and videos compare brand new mats. Here the Thermarest NeoAir Xlite NXT is mentioned very positively because of its light weight and high r-value. I had one of the first self-inflating Term-a-rest pads in the 90s. I used them for many years and never had a problem with them. However, when I searched for articles about first-hand experiences with the NeoAir Xlite, I was surprised to see that many people struggled with pad malfunctions. The most noticeable was the balloon effect, where some inner chambers burst and merged into one large one. Another malfunction is the serious reduction in initial R-value, as almost immediately after the first use of the pad, the inner aluminum layer begins to flake off. Some have misinterpreted this as mold, as when the mattress is held up to a light source, it appears to have dark spots on the inside. It seems to me that a lot of comparison videos (of the influencer type) are made by simply buying a bunch of well-known brand mattresses, ""testing"" them (by reading through the specs and laying on them for a minute to make a short video), and then sending them back to get their money back. And of course, the problems mentioned above may not be noticed.

So my question is: Where can I find reviews from people who have used sleeping pads at least 20 times and for over a year? For example, is the Thermarest NeoAir® XTherm™ NXT more durable than the Xlite, or should I even consider the Exped Dura 5R, which is twice as heavy, has a lower R-value, but has a much stronger material? What good is a super light mat if it breaks during the trip?",Ultralight

We'll have spray on our belts, walk in groups making noise in any thick brush. And understand the campsites have separate food/storage areas and sleeping areas. Thats all easy - no issues there.  Most of my miles have been in the Sierra so plenty familiar with standard bear protocols from black bears etc.

The main question I guess is how extra cautious do you have to be with smells? I hear things like bringing separate clothes to eat in and stuff like that? Or I guess just eat in your stinky trail stuff and change after dinner to ""camp"" clothes? My typical system is to just pack extra socks and maybe long-johns depending on weather, but sleep in the same stuff I hike in. I guess a change of clothes isn't the end of the world, but I want to at least be making an informed decision and not ""packing my fears"" if you know what I mean.

Exped seems better on paper, but there are hardly any reviews I can find, on the other hand Sea to Summit seems to be a more reputable brand. I think I would appreciate a bit wider size of Sea to Summit.

466,1690709346.0,Blind Banana Bags 65L review,"Facts and figures:

Brand: Blind Banana Bags
Type: Big Mike 65L
Torso M hip belt S
Price: €450
Weight: 980 gr

As I’ve bought this pack about 6 months ago and have done some day hikes first, then a weekend trip and then 2 10-day trips, I thought it’s time for a review of the pack. 

It is my first UL pack. I’ve had an osprey aether 70 for years and I loved it, but as it’s 2,4 kg I wanted something lighter and found the Blind Banana Bag (BBB). 

I wanted this one as I didn’t like the adjustment of the hip bekt of HMG packs (pulling outward is stupid) and I wasn’t able to test ULA in real. The other option was Atom Packs, but their lead time was 3 months for a custom pack… 

The first impression was good. I’ve had contact with the guy who makes the packs for some customisation options. Then I had to wait for 4 weeks and the pack arrived. The pack itself looks and feels durable and well made. The aluminium frame is U shaped (upside down U) and thin, but it didn’t bend when I tried. The shoulder straps and hip belt are thick and solid. The straps to adjust the straps, however, are very thin. So when you adjust the pack and are not aware, they will turn around and that can make adjustment frustrating. 

The space inside the pack there is a lot of space, a water bladder pocket and I’ve ordered a small pocket for keys and passports as well. These extra pockets are removable to save weight, but I didn’t remove them. 

You can remove the hip belt as well. I’ve removed it for my last day hike when I filled the pack with around 7 kg and the comfort was still OK. Not perfect as all weight is on the shoulders, but good enough and it makes the pack more versatile. 

While hiking I was surprised by the comfort of the pack. Compared to the Osprey, the BBB is more wobbly and less stiff, but with weights up to 13-14 kg it was very comfortable. I’ve loaded the BBB with 18 kg at the start of a multi day hike, then it was less comfortable. I found that the hip belt was still nice, but I missed stiffness I think. It felt like the weight distribution was more towards the shoulders than with the same weight in the Osprey. 

Accessories like the two huge side pockets are great. You can store 2x 1,5L bottles in each of them. Sadly there is no drainage hole in the bottom of the side pockets, so you can collect rain there. I found the front and bottom
Mesh useful, I wonder how long the bottom pocket will last, as it’s on the bottom, and made of mesh. It’s still fine now, but I haven’t scratched a rock yet… 

And talking about rain: the pack is water proof. It held up great in a day full of pouring rain. 

Things I like: light weight pack, lots of pockets, comfortable up to 14 kg, heavier weighs are doable if needed, shoulder strap pocket got your phone 

Things I didn’t like: thin adjustment straps, lack of compression options, not as colourful as Atom Packs, the price

All in all I like the pack a lot and it’s my go to pack now. Maybe for winter camping I’ll grab the Osprey as it carries heavier loads easier. It was a very expensive pack, but that’s no difference from other UL packs.

468,1690684910.0,Review: Shokz Aftershokz OpenMoove Headphones,"I have had my shokz for just over a month now with 5 trail days, ~50 trail miles, and another 20 days of use around the house.  These are bone conduction headphones which I had never tried before.

The good: I find them very comfortable.  I would say it feels similar to putting some sunglasses on the back of your head.  I wear glasses and did not have an issue pairing the shokz with my glasses or sunglasses.

More good: They address all the problems I have with airpods.  They are essentially waterproof and have 0 risk of shaking out and falling somewhere impossible to find.  They also weigh less than airpods (with their charging case), only 29 grams.  They also don't have issues with accumulating grime.  Because the contact point against your head is smooth it doesn't really get earwax or anything and it's also easy to clean.

The bad: Sound quality is somewhere between 6/10 and 8/10, they're great for playing stuff in the background but aren't the best for fidelity.  Music that has a lot of range and volume can create a weird buzzing feeling if it's too loud.  You can't lay down with them on normally, but you can turn them around like you are playing cyclops from x-men and that works OK.  Also they don't pack super well because of their shape.

Shokz has other models but this is the only one that is usb c rechargeable, the others have proprietary cables which was a deal breaker for me.  I am extremely happy with my $80 and would recommend these to anyone looking for sport headphones.",Ultralight

473,1690659535.0,40f or 30f top quilt for PNW summers?,"

Hi all,

Should I get a 40f or 30f Hammock Gear top quilt for summers hiking around the PNW?

I’m moving to the Seattle area from Montana soon to continue my schooling. I’m a hammock camper doing mostly weekend/overnights. I’d like to do longer trips soon.

**My current insulation setup** ([lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/934aen)) is a 20f 3/4 length HG under quilt and a DIY top quilt that’s basically two costco down throws. This setup is ~ok~ down to the low 30s, good Jun-Sept in MT.

I finally have the dough to get a proper top quilt, and I’m wondering whether a 30f or 40f one would be better for summers in the PNW? I’ll layer my old quilts for the shoulder seasons.

I would love the lightness of a 40f quilt, but I’m worried it will just be a bit too cold.

I don’t really know the Seattle area well enough to really give much detail on the types of hikes I’m likely to attempt. Obviously I’d be camping below the tree line.

Some other related questions I have:
- what size tree straps would be appropriate for the PNW?
- what does bear safety look like out there?
- any other notes for hammock camping in the PNW?

Please let me know your thoughts!

Thank you

EDIT: I ended up getting a 20f quilt (hammock gear Econ) based on all the comments below and my own math. First, I sleep slightly cold and it seems like it’s if anything colder than MT. Secondly, my old quilts are so heavy that bringing one to layer in the shoulder seasons ends up being heavier, on average, than just getting one nice cottage quilt for 3 seasons.",Ultralight

475,1690641534.0,Shakedown For Vermont AT 4-Day Mileage Challenge,"Hi All,

I'm planning to go to the southern terminus of the Vermont AT tomorrow and hike north as far as I can from Sunday - Wednesday, so about 4 days. My wife is willing to pick me up wherever I end up. I'm hoping to cover around 30+ miles/day. This will be my first true fastpack that lasts longer than 24-ish hours, so I'm somewhat nervous about my gear and food selections. Have been training all year for this, and have done multiple 6-9 hour 30-35 mile single days. Looking to get any feedback from you all, or tips about the Vermont AT!

I plan to hike from sun-up to around sundown each day, but I don't \*plan\* to do any night hiking.

I've gone back and forth between the poncho tarp and bivy setup or bringing my hammock setup with a rain jacket (adds about 6 or 7 oz), and gone back and forth between alcohol and canister stove. I know it's dumb to bring a book, but I'm an English teacher and old habits die hard. I may leave it behind, but that's a long time to go without reading for me.

This is my lighterpack, and it includes all of my food choices as well, including cal/oz. Worried that the Mountain House meals will suck, but I have so many gifted to me by friends  Thank you for any feedback! [https://lighterpack.com/r/5w8hye](https://lighterpack.com/r/5w8hye)

Edit: Thanks for all the help and feedback! Ditched the candy in favor of more fat/salt-heavy snacks and ended up with more calories (about 3800/day). Ditched the book. Going to keep the power bank because I need to be able to call my ride at the end of the trail and not willing to risk it. Going to make a game-time decision on pants v. shorts. I can see why people go stoveless, now looking at the calorie/weight ratio of my cooked food (will probably do this next time. Tempted to do it on this trip). Feel ready, pack feels good. Thanks again!

UPDATE: For anyone who is new to fastpacking who happens upon this thread, I wanted to put my results and thoughts quickly. 

1. I was able to stick to my proposed mileage pretty easily. I could have gone further for sure, but I didn't always trust myself to be okay the next morning. Had a 30 mile/day average, with about 11-12 hours of moving per day, during which I took about 30 minutes of breaks spread out -- usually a 5-10 minute break every three hours. Next time, I'll be trying to push for 40 miles/day and 13-15 hours hiking.
2. I've always loved cooking while backpacking, but when fastpacking it is such an annoying chore. It steals crucial daylight hours and I just never even wanted to do it. For the last 24 hour period, I tried going no-cook and it was so much better. I'm converted. I think I just needed to see it for myself. Going no-cook for all fastpacking trips in the future.
3. I had too much food. I came home with almost 6000 calories uneaten. I gave 7 bars to a thru hiker on the last night.
4. Never again will I bring an inflatable sleeping pad. Closed cell foam 4-eva.
5. Staying in and around AT shelters while fastpacking is fun. You spend all day in your own head, in the green tunnel, then you get to spend twenty minutes chatting with people before bed. What a great cool down.
6. I had a total blast. What a fun way to travel. All the rest of my gear worked well.

I'm almost positive it was the sweat that was making them loosen up. The little written centimeter number on the pole slowly became distorted and blurred throughout the day at the point of where it was tightened. It had the salty sweat at the point of friction all day long.

I know we can cut weight with our cook system. We currently share a pot and then bring our own plastic cups for drinks and oatmeal. Looking at moving us to two separate TOAKS 550ml pots, or sharing a 1100ml pot. Either way is a significant weight savings - but if we go with two separate pots than we can chuck the plastic cups too. With this - also thinking of adding another stove so we can just cook our meals separately but simultaneously.

**Water:**

I was shocked at the weight of the Platypus water filter when putting this together, but honestly we're both pretty impatient with filtering water and the Sawyer was pretty frustrating when we were trying to get water for camp. We regularly go through the 4L for dinner, and breakfast so it's nice to only get water once and be good for the night.

**Electronics:**

I've looked at getting the Anker or Nitecore power banks, but I got this one for free and i can get about 2 full phone charges out of it and 2-3 watch charges. Might need to get a second since for 8 days and two people idk if it'll be enough.

**Safety:**

My first aid kit has become a wild stuff sack of misc. things, so I'll cut it down. Not sure about the map, I never carry one but for this thru it might be a good idea? My multi-tool currently has a paracord strap that's adding weight - makes it easy to grab but otherwise pretty useless.

**Clothes:**

I made a silnylon rain jacket last year with mesh pit vents, but siln isn't breathable and since I know we'll get caught in some storms I'm wondering if I should go back to my 11oz REI rain jacket, or 12 oz poncho. Neither are really UL but they're breathable and can withstand heavy rain. That or I could try to get frogg toggs before I leave, but idk if they'll be much different than my silnylon rain jacket. Also - I'm torn between shorts and pants, I've been getting pretty bad hikers rash on my shins and feet this summer, so I've been sticking to short socks, ditched the dirty girl gaiters and have been wearing shorts - but idk if I'll regret not having pants on this hike with all the downfall.Thanks!",Ultralight
496,1690391244.0,I give up! I need help! Sleeping bags :/,"I have a hammock Gear 30deg quilt that is all I’ve ever used. I hiked the PCT with it. No issues. I’m a warm sleeper, and I don’t mind layering. But, I’m looking to get into a bit more mountaineering.

I would like to add two more bags into my arsenal, a really quality 4 season one (which is not the point of this post so ignore this) as well as one in between the 4 season and the quilt (this is the point of this post)

I went down the rabbit hole and started a spreadsheet ([https://imgur.com/a/mjryeA8](https://imgur.com/a/mjryeA8) ). But I want to pull in some opinions. 

I’m looking for around a 10-15 deg bag. As light weight as possible. For a fair value. Full zip preferred. I identified some budget options but I always feel like I’m sacrificing on something. I’m wondering if I should just splurge on a FF one. The main question is can I go with a 20deg FF? I hear they are a lot warmer then other bags so I’m wondering if a 20F FF would be better than say a 10 or 15F budget option. 

Also, I’m a side/stomach sleeper and I toss and turn a lot.

497,1690389811.0,Montbell Japan and Exofficio Sandfly Pants Impressions,"First impressions after about 100 miles of day hiking:

\-----------------------------------------

Exofficio Sandfly Pants:

211.2g / 7.45oz

[Link](https://www.amazon.com/ExOfficio-Mens-BugsAway-Sandfly-Pant/dp/B011AQURG4/) 

I believe that exofficio has discontinued making anything except underwear and undershirts. I was able to find these on Amazon as old new stock. Sizing and availability is very limited. 

Anywho, these are some lightweight pants treated with insect shield that have large vents on the inside of each pant leg from about mid thigh to mid calf. The fit/cut is acceptable, but does ever so slightly hinder range of motion when you lift your knee up high.

The vents make a huge difference for your legs, but it doesn't really appear to help keep your crotch cool. The fabric is definitely light, but not as light as the MH Trail Senders. It does have several metal snaps towards the bottom that allow you to efficiently roll up your pant legs into capris for added coolness. The pockets are quite large, and the right side pocket has a bonus zippered pocket inside of it. It fits like normal pants; definitely not joggers. There is no drawstring, but has belt loops instead.

I think that all the extra zippers, snaps, and pockets add quite a bit of weight when compared to the other pants on my [Guide to Sierra Summer Wear](https://imgur.com/a/aCThT23). It definitely feels like the pants that are about an ounce lighter.

These pants get dirty surprisingly easy.

It's a solid choice for hiking in the heat. I don't think it beats the MH Trail Senders or OR Astro pants, but from first impressions it appears to be good enough to make it somewhere positive on my list of good pants in the high Sierra heat. The sorta poor fit makes me reach for my other options first, though.

I am tempted to commission someone to modify my Trail Sender pants by adding similar vents to them.

The rest of my first impressions came from Montbell Japan.

Montbell Cool Light Long Sleeve Zip Shirt:

122.6g / 4.32oz

[Link](https://en.montbell.jp/products/goods/disp.php?product_id=1114454) 

This is a pretty nice shirt. Amongst the other shirts I own, it reminds me the most of the Arc'teryx Cormac. The fabrics are quite similar, but the Montbell appears to be softer and possibly cooler. I bought the Montbell in Japan size XL, which fits halfway between an American medium and Large. In fact it fits damn near the same as my Cormac size medium (which runs a little big).

The sleeves are an acceptable length. Any shorter at all and I'd complain, but it definitely works as is. While an extra inch or two would be nice, the shorter length probably helps keep the heat controlled a bit better. For reference, my dress shirts have a sleeve length of 34/35 inches. The same could be said about the torso length. Any shorter would be a problem, I'd prefer an extra inch or three, but it's acceptable as-is. The only real problem with the measurements is that you can get a few mosquito bites when bending over and whatnot.

Overall it's a great shirt that definitely can compete with the others on my list, but I can't imagine it can beat the OR Echo, MH Crater Lake, or OR Astroman. It definitely compares directly to the Cormac, but I think the Montbell is a slightly better choice. At least I think so, I need to use it more before I make a firm decision on that.

\------------------------------------------------------

Montbell Cool Fingerless Gloves:

23.4g / 0.83oz

[Link](https://en.montbell.jp/products/goods/disp.php?product_id=1118305) 

These compare directly to the Glacier Glove Ascension Bay sun gloves. They both have a pseudo leather palm with lightweight fabric for the rest. The sizing chart on Montbell Japan's website is kinda weird for glove measurement because it has you go at an angle instead of straight across your palm. But anywho, I bought a size large in the Montbell and it fits just like a size large Glacier Glove. The montbell is maybe a tiny bit tighter. (For reference, the Glacier Gloves size large fits just like a size large OR Active Ice glove).

My biggest pet peeve with the Montbell glove is that the pseudo leather on the fingers extends out a bit further than the fabric does on top of your fingers, which leads to it folding/bunching up a little bit sometimes against your trekking poles. It's really no big deal, but a similar reason is why I don't like my OR Active Ice gloves (their fingers have too thick of hemming). Update after a few more hikes: after breaking in the Montbell gloves a bit more, they have become much more comfortable. The ""leather"" flaps have become much less of a nuisance.

Again, the Cool fingerless gloves appear to be a solid choice. I \*think\* that they will be second choice for me, right behind the Glacier Glove Ascension Bay gloves.

Montbell Wide Brim Hat:

92.1g / 3.25oz

[Link](https://en.montbell.jp/products/goods/disp.php?product_id=1108743) 

It definitely keeps your cool. I bought a size XL and it fits like a Sunday Afternoon size L/XL. The Sunday Afternoon might be slightly bigger. It has one large vent wrapping around the sides and backside.

The brim is a bit malleable. You can push it up and it stays up, you can push it down and it stays. However, it does not take much breeze for the brim to be pushed back up. This is a major nuisance. The sides can also be snapped upwards.

The rear brim is just like the front. Compared to the Sunday afternoon ultra adventure hat, the Montbell does not annoyingly flap in the wind. However, the Montbell might brush against your backpack, especially if you're using your extension collar or a taller pack.

There is no neck strap, but there are loops that would allow you to create your own.

My first guess is that, temperature wise, this hat is on par with the Ultra Adventure hat. However, the Montbell's brim being pushed up by the breeze is somewhat of a fatal flaw. Because of that, I can't recommend this hat for hiking. It is a perfectly acceptable option for gardening or other more basic activities.

Pull Top Flex Water Pack 500ml

37.1g / 1.31oz

[Link](https://en.montbell.jp/products/goods/disp.php?product_id=1124879) 

Not too expensive and definitely works. The bottom design fits a bit better in my shoulder strap pockets when compared to the rounder bottoms of my Hydrapaks. I don't think that it fits any of the normal ultralight water filters. Water flow through the bite valve is a bit slower than I'd like. It unlocks by pulling the bite valve out a bit. Transparent.

\------------------------------------------------------

Anywho, I've only used these items the past two or three weeks on day hikes totaling about 100 miles. I'll most likely add them to my [Sierra Summer Wear Guide](https://imgur.com/a/aCThT23) this fall after I've given them all a proper shot. I probably won't do any overnight trips this year because I have a newborn.

498,1690386292.0,"Sunproof, long sleeve button shirt by European producer","I'm searching for long sleeve button shirt that would be:

499,1690381300.0,Ultralight Sling Pack Recommendations? Adapting to One-Shoulder Carry Post-Injury,"Greetings, friends!

As many of us here know, one of the core philosophies behind ultralight backpacking is reducing the physical strain that comes with carrying heavy packs. It's about being mindful of what we bring with us into the wilderness, all in the name of comfort, enjoyment, and longevity in our adventures. Today, I'm reaching out with a very personal application of this philosophy.

Due to an unfortunate shoulder injury, I can no longer bear weight on my right shoulder. I've always been an avid backpacker, and I refuse to let this setback keep me from the trails. My solution? I'm looking to transition to a sling pack, aiming to comfortably carry my load over my unaffected left shoulder. Ultralight principles seem more relevant than ever, as minimizing weight and optimizing load distribution are now key to me continuing my backpacking journey.

So, to all you seasoned ultralight adventurers: Could you please share your wisdom and suggest suitable ultralight sling packs, or innovative DIY setups, which can handle a single-shoulder load? Here are some factors I'd appreciate if you could consider:

1. **Ultralight:** As part of this community, we all understand the importance of weight. Please mention the pack's weight and how it contributes to reducing overall load.

2. **Comfort & Balance:** How comfortable is the pack when loaded? How well does it distribute the weight across the body, especially when limited to one shoulder?

3. **Durability & Quality:** Given the increased strain on a single point, the pack's durability is crucial. How has your recommendation held up over time?

4. **Capacity:** Despite being ultralight, it should still carry essential gear. What volume can it reasonably hold?

5. **Cost-Effectiveness:** We know ultralight gear can be expensive. Does your recommendation provide good value for its price?

Additionally, if you have any advice on adapting my packing strategy, gear organization, or overall hiking approach to this one-shoulder ultralight setup, I'd be immensely grateful. Insights on maintaining balance, compensating for the uneven weight, or any related tips would be highly valuable.

My hope is that this post not only helps me adapt to my new circumstances but also serves as a resource for others who may face similar challenges in the future. Ultralight backpacking, with its ethos of minimalism and adaptability, seems ideally suited to meet such challenges.

Thank you in advance for your shared wisdom, and keep embracing the ultralight way!",Ultralight
