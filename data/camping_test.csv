16,1697727523.0,How to layer wool with down?,"It reaches down to -30c (-22f) in the winter here and I wanna optimize my gear so I'm not lugging unnecessary things around. I usually don't hike for super long distances, I focus on the chill camping part hence me using wool most of the time.  

My current winter layers would look like:  

1. Base layers (hopefully merino wool this winter)
2. Thick wool sweater
3. Down jacket from Uniqlo (For when it's below -15c)
4. Levis sherpa jacket
5. Fjallraven Vidda Pro jacket for outer shell

Hats, gloves, joggers with Vidda Pro insulated pants on top etc.  

If I'm wearing these 5 layers for the worst days is this the correct order? I could potentially fit the down under the wool but I dont wanna stretch my awesome sweater.

I might get a north face down jacket to replace the cheap one I have and get rid of the Levis from this system I have. I don't trust the synthetic materials to hold up to trees so I always put the vidda pro over everything.  ",camping

Our kids are hitting the age where camping and hiking is more fun than a chore, and I enjoy it too, with one exception: I sleep TERRIBLY in a tent. 

I'm of the age where sleeping wrong means a lot of pain not just in the morning, but also during the night. I also have some joint issues that mean I can only sleep in certain positions (back or stomach) or risk flaring up bursitis. We have sleeping pads, but they are Not Enough. On our most recent trip, I gave up around 4 am and moved to the car to get the only solid 3 hour stretch of sleep of the night.

I'm trying to decide between an air mattress (in my experience, they always deflate, and even if they don't put me on the ground, they wobble enough to make sleep restless), a cot (worried about size and comfort), or some other solution I don't know yet. 

We car camp, but there are four of us, which can mean that fitting all the gear required can be difficult, so size/compactness of the solution matters.

So instead, instead we're looking for options to car camp for a couple of nights while he's here mid-November (weekend before Thanksgiving, I know).

Majority of the sites at the campground are reserved, so others are clearly ok with it. I've camped in Idyllwild this time of year and perfectly fine, but that's not on the water like Big Bear is. My fiance and I will sleep in our car / tent set up so we'll be fine, but our friend (from a very warm weather country) will be in a regular tent (I'll give him our best insulation/sleeping pads) so wanted a gut check - are we pushing it too late in the season for good chances to camp up there comfortably, sans any early winter weather?

It brought he back to the days of the boyscouts. It just made sense. No disposable propane tanks and I can make use of my extensive cast iron collection. The guy I got it from said the tank wouldn't pressurize, and he was right. I saw some posts on here about massaging the leather pump gasket with some oil, and let me tell you, it worked like a charm! Fired right up! I was concerned that this thing wouldn't heat up my cast iron fast enough, but boy was I wrong. Put my pan on, went inside to get some eggs and butter up some bread, by the time I got back out my pan was smoking like crazy!

Most provincial parks around me don't allow camping or are closed for the season already, plus I'd rather not have to pay. I've gone camping before, but only in provincial park campgrounds.

I used the crown land atlas map to look for crown land nearby, and there definitely is crown land around in southern Ontario, even in the GTA , though obviously they're not as big areas as in northern Ontario. But they're just 40 mins drive away from me, so it'd be perfect if I want to camp a night whenever I want.

An issue I found though is that these patches of General Use Area are usually surrounded by private land, either residential areas or farms, so I don't know how to get there without trespassing, sometimes there's dirt roads, but I think they're private roads for the farms, sometimes theres rivers running by them so theoretically you could just take a canoe there but its really inconvenient. If you guys have any information, I'd appreciate it, but I'm thinking I'll forget about these spots.

I did find another good area thats designated as a Provincial Wildlife Area on the map, and on the policy report it says Crown Land Recreation is permitted, so I guess I could camp there, its a relatively larger area, and theres a river running across it, theres also roads that go across. The only issue I have here is where to park my car, its mostly just farms around the area, but there are roads with wide gravel shoulders, could I just park it there, and then hike into the forest?",camping

A few clarifications;

1) I meant a mile or two from a more populated area such as a designated camp site. I would be maybe a few hundred feet off the trail, and I'm unsure from the road until I go scope camp spots. The mile or two from a more populated  area was just with the idea if my kid falls in poop and absolutely must wash off in a water pump or something. The kinds of situations you don't really know if it might happen until your kids have been on a few camping trips and know how to act carefully. However, as mentioned in edit 1, I've learned there are places you can drive right up to a dispersed camping spot.

2) The first several trips will be in groups with family and friends. I didn't mention that because it wasn't relevant to the questions I'm asking, like what gear I need, and also because I want to plan way ahead for when I am comfortable going with just my kids. The first trip would likely be 5-7 adults and 4-11 kids, with my 2 being the youngest, several technically adults, but kids of the family.

3) It's completely accurate that I don't know what kinds of things I need to plan for, which is why I'm asking 5-6 months before I plan on taking the first camping trip like this, probably around March or April. I can spend those 5-6 months doing things like taking an emergency first aid class, even though one of my planned camping partners is a nurse, so I can be better prepared for when I do decide to camp alone with my kids. A lot of y'all are responding like I'm packing up to go get lost in the deep forest tomorrow with 2 kids and no planning or anything. Lol.

4) Their dad is not involved in a way that could be helpful for my kids to have experiences like this, so it's 100% on me to do that with no help. I will always try to give them good experiences, obviously in a safe way with months of planning for higher risk activities.


Original post:
I'm looking at taking my kids (4 and 5 years old) camping at Hoosier National Forest in Indiana next spring/summer. I have all the basic camping gear, but have only camped at a tent site. My son was very disappointed we weren't in the woods. I plan to camp within a mile or two of a recreation area or a tent site, just in case anything were to happen with 2 little kids, I don't want to be wayyy out away from civilization. My kids just did a 5 mile hike, and told me ""that wasn't even a hike, it was just a walk"" so I know 1-2 miles would be fine for them. All that being said, I've never been wilderness camping, and am wondering if I need extra gear (besides some sort of restroom facilities), than what I would need at a tent site?

Also, for anyone familiar with Hoosier National specifically, what kind of critters do I need to watch out for? My area really has nothing particularly concerning... coyotes, raccoons, foxes. No bears, no venomous snakes, nothing that really has a good chance of taking you out, so just wondering what I'd need to keep an eye out for there?

Lastly, any tips for camping with kids that age are appreciated. We had a really awesome weekend last time camping, so I don't expect issues, but we'll probably do a longer trip to Hoosier National.

Oh, and final question, our dog will be coming too, so tips for extended camping with her. Obviously food, water, bowls, leash, treats, tieout. She sleeps in the tent with us, so no separate bed. I do have a tick key (for her & us), but anything I may not be thinking of?",camping
77,1697525221.0,"R-value testing of cardboard, various blankets, etc.?","Does anyone know of any R-value testing done on cardboard, blankets, and other things you might be able to easily find at home, especially using the ASTM F3340-18 standard? Ground pads are cheap but I'm thinking if a new camper just wants to grab whatever they happen to have at home to get out into somewhat cold weather, how much and what should I tell them to grab? I'm sure a big enough pile of blankets would eventually reach any desired R-value but I'd love to be able to provide some guidelines as to how much and what types of common at-home blankets would best, although less compactable blankets intuitively seem to make the most sense.

I'm thinking particularly in terms of scouting, when a scout might invite a non-camper friend on a trip whose parents aren't ready to start spending money on the scout's gear but we certainly wouldn't want them to have a miserable night of sleep. (And, for argument's sake, assume we've got no loaner gear for this camper.)",camping

Probably will have to wait until next year but would like to start researching now. 

There is a fairly new group a few hours from me in ATL, but they only do it for a day or two and its always on the days I work.  I will still keep trying to join them one day. I have been waiting forever to go on my first camping trip, met a girl group here on reddit and on tiktok that I joined to go on a group trip with, but both ended up canceling the event for various reasons. I have been buying equipment for awhile now. 

Thought I would find a guy that would take me camping but no such luck, last ex despised the outdoors was a musician and stayed in clubs,  no wonder that didnt workout. So, I dont want to simply wait until my next relationship to try to go again. 

Everytime I think a trip is going to happen it gets canceled for some reason that has nothing to do with me. And no, I do not want to just go by myself, especially not the first time or just do it in my backyard. I want a real camping experience with people that have the knowledge and expertise.

Burn the burnables, collect the non-burnables for the landfills, etc. my question is in regards to what all you would dispose of by burning in your campfire? Paper products are obvious. But what about plastics, paper/plastic hybrids, etc? Is burning those a grievous sin as well? I understand chemical by-products released from burning things such as plastic outside of the proper facilities, but is my one weekend of camping really affecting things?

Edit: I appreciate the replies, even the ones that come off as condescending. To clarify a couple of things:

I was raised in the woods far removed from civilization. I have a healthy respect for nature and preserving it. The fact that I’m asking the question and wanting to improve my understanding/practices should somewhat reflect that. 

The camping I’m referring to is at a public campground in the center of my city. It has a dedicated fire pit. It’s not backcountry or very remote. I can drive my car 3 minutes and be in the nearest neighborhood. I’m not trying to diminish the importance of LNT, but the footprint of humanity is here regardless of my participation in good/bad practices. 

I agree with anyone who says the mentality of “what I do doesn’t matter,” is a bad state of mind. However, I am a realist at heart and believe that until we fix the pollution caused by large corporations, whether or not we individually dedicate our lives to green living doesn’t matter and the 1% are going to cause more environmental damage than we ever could.",camping

168,1697223577.0,New California campsite reservation law,"Finally, a good step in the right direction for the California campground reservation system.

""You could be banned from California campgrounds for bailing on your campsite reservation"" 

""A new bill signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsome aims to deter no-shows, including banning repeat offenders.

Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan introduced Assembly Bill 618. It makes several changes to how California State Parks (CSP) will handle camping reservations.

The law states that campers must cancel their booking seven days before arrival. Those who don’t will lose their reservation fee, the cost of the first night’s stay and will incur an $8 cancellation fee. If campers don’t show up by the day after their reservation date, the CSP will cancel the remaining days on their reservation. If a camper is a no-show three or more times in a calendar year, CSP can ban them from making new reservations.

To make it easier for campers to make reservations, the law makes campsites more available by limiting the number of days people can stay at the same campsite in a year to 30 and limits the length of reservations during peak season to seven consecutive nights. The bill will also implement a lottery system by 2025 for five of the most popular park campsites, to be determined by the CSP based on advanced booking interest.

The new laws take effect January 1, 2024""

While I try to beans remote as possible, there are times I have to pay for a site in a state park or similar.  For work reasons, on the east coast I’ve had to spend 11 days at a state park and so I picked the cheapest campground, no utilities and furthest from the rest.  All week it has been peaceful and other campers have been quiet and respectful.  

Enter today.   A family rolls up in two vehicles, and bursts from them yelling, screaming, running, etc.  Not just the kids  but the parents  who are trying to yell over their kids acting like their buddies instead of their parents.    They echo through the whole river valley.  After they get set up, the mother and father break out guitars and start playing and singing LOUDLY as if they are auditioning for American Idol.  This went on for hours.  You could tell they were pissing off everyone else and one camper from the end of the campground yelled SHUT UP.  
I was in the campsite next to these people.  

Point is, take notice of the vibe when you arrive.  Are people partying or is it quiet?   What are other campers doing?   Are they playing music or are they enjoying the serenity of nature?

201,1697090043.0,Have you had any scary or life-threatening experiences while camping?,"Back in 2021 my husband and I were camping in Wyoming at the Boysen Reservoir. We got really lucky and were able to book a “beach” front site, directly leading to the water but the downside was that it was very, very far away from the other campsites. We were essentially isolated from everyone else, at the time though it sounded like a dream come true. 

The thing about Wyoming is that it’s so desolate to the point where it’s pitch black and eerily dead silent once the sun is gone. We set up our camp, enjoyed our fire, but shortly after that, a random SUV with blacked out windows came driving down our road and into our site. 

They drove towards us, my husband tried to wave to them in case they were lost and needed help, but instead they ignored us and drove down to the beach, stayed there for 5 minutes, turned around and went back up the way they came. 

We immediately got a bad vibe, my husband told me to throw everything in the car and he kept shining a flashlight towards the beach because we had a feeling they dropped someone off to watch us. After we packed up we got in the car and hauled ass. Lo and behold, the same car drove back into our campsite and when they saw us leaving, they actually started chasing us. Mind you, the roads in Wyoming are bumpy and unkept when you’re in the wilderness- on top of that, enormous wildlife that wanders in and out of the streets. My husband said “I have to go fast, are you ok with that?” And I said “just go and get us out of here.” 

We were easily going 80mph down these windy roads and even through a canyon, they were on our tail for about 10 mins until we lost them after passing through the canyon. Most terrifying experience of our lives, we think about it to this day and wonder what could’ve happened if we didn’t listen to our gut at that moment.

Edit: wow! I had no idea this would blow up. To those who shared their stories and experiences like this post was intended for, thank you. 
To those who made it a debate about guns, you do you- but I want to live, and not be ignorant to the fact that dangerous people do, in fact, exist. 

And to those who claimed I’m either lying or paranoid- for one, we tried to engage with them, but these folk barreled past us without a word. First red flag. Two, our site was so isolated, why would anyone pull up to our campsite just to sit at the beach for a few minutes and then leave? You can’t drive across the sand to the other campsites because of the water, so if you’re coming to our site, you’re doing it for a reason. Second red flag. We were chased by them for miles after we started leaving, so it’s pretty self explanatory at that point. Boom, suspicions confirmed. 🙄  thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",camping

211,1697058813.0,Best sleeping pad,"Hey there. Recently went camping where it got down to 38 degrees. Not horrible, but definitely cold. My husband and I have an air mattress that is low to the ground. Our setup was this: mattress, fluffy mattress topper (not foam), big comforter, our sleeping bags, warmer clothes. I felt comfortable in my sleeping bag & clothes but our air mattress lost some air because of the cold (I think). 

Anyway, looking for a sleeping pad that isn't inflatable & is comfy. I was very sore in my shoulders and back from the air mattress. Wondering if a sleeping pad would be better for more comfort. I tend to kick and move A LOT in my sleep, if that context helps lol. Planning to do at least one more fall trip.

214,1697050714.0,A Different Cold-Weather Camping Question,"I see a lot of questions about cold-weather camping. Here’s my sincere question. I hate cold weather and I hate being cold. I think I could manage the sleeping part, which is what most questions focus on. Good sleeping bag, liner, pad, blankets, socks, hot water bottle. I’m sure I could be toasty in my bag and have a great night. 

But during the day? How do you stay warm and not miserable? What do you do while winter camping? Do you do the same as not-cold weather camping - like hiking, staring at the campfire, reading, looking at the stars? Or do you have winter-specific camping activities? Hunting or winter sports?

As much as I dislike the cold, I think a warm and cozy night of sleep in cold weather sounds blissful. It’s that time outside of the sleeping bag I’m trying to understand. 

It’s a sincere question. I’m interested in trying winter camping but I want to better understand what y’all do during the day in cold weather.",camping

217,1697042053.0,-30C(-22F) Winter Camping Questions,"Hello! I’m starting to upgrade a lot of my fall/winter gear this season, and I have some questions!  

I live in Alberta Canada, so the winter conditions will drop down to -30C (-22F). My summer gear is ultralight and I’d like to do the same with my winter setup, but safety and warmth are my number one priority.  I’ve camped in -34C once before with older gear, and had a blast. 

I’m looking at EE custom sleeping quilts, their Conundrum quilt looks promising! 950pp, It’s rated to -23C (-10F), if I pair that with a sleeping pad with an r-value of 7.3 (NeoAir XTherm NXT Sleeping Pad) would that be comfortable at -30C (-22F)?  I’d be fine wearing multiple layers to sleep in if needed. 

Will I notice a huge difference between a 7.3 (NeoAir XTherm) and an 8 (DURA 8R) r-value? There’s quite a large weight difference between the two. 

How do you like to layer your clothing in these temperatures?  Do you use any of your summer clothing in your winter gear list?  And do you have any pointers or tips that you wish you had known before you started winter camping?",camping

That's about it. There was no amplified music. I didn't hear any generators. There were no drunken arguments. Honestly, the most exciting thing was a couple deer that passed by.

I don't know if y'all were hoping for some horror story or something; I know Reddit loves drama. Sometimes all that drama is exhausting. Sometimes, you just want to camp in a national park, and see a bunch of stars at night. We saw a ton of stars. The only real negative thing was the price of firewood.

Big Meadows is great. It has a ton of facilities. The meadows are in fact, big. It's near a bunch of cool trails. I get that Shenandoah ain't no Yosemite or even Acadia, but for a lot of people, it's fairly close to where they live.

Some caveats:

* Big Meadows campground is huge. There could have a bunch of loud drunken people blasting music in some other section, who knows.
* It did get down to the mid 30s. Maybe the kind of people who get really wild are the type who can't handle the cold.
* Big Meadows is basically fully booked all the time. You're not gonna walk-in with your stuff

270,1696878716.0,Lost it on some neighboring campers (rant),"Went camping with the family this weekend (wife, 9 yr old daughter, and 7 yr old son).  Loved everything about the campsite and area, except for the inconsiderate neighbors we had.  Like most campsites, ours had a quite time policy from 10PM - 7AM.  The campsite next to ours had people from at least 3 other campsites gathered there.  Probably at least 10-12 people.  They never really made any effort to be quiet so we weren't surprised when 10:00 rolled around and they kept going as normal.  No music but just talking and laughing very loudly.  Even with earplugs in, they were still going strong at midnight and keeping us up when I finally decided to go say something in not the most polite of ways.  They did quiet down somewhat after that, but at that point I was so pissed I ended up getting maybe 1-2 hours of sleep.  My wife and kids didn't fare much better either.  

The next day, between being already being sick and now deliriously exhausted I wasn't in the most tolerant of moods to say the least, nor feeling very kindly towards our inconsiderate neighbors.  As we're eating lunch, we watch them set up some stands that were about 5ft tall about 30 ft apart from each other on the gravel spot for where you would set tents up, put empty glass beer bottles on the stands then proceed to try to knock them off with a frisbee.  As anyone with a few functioning braincells could see happening, it didn't take long for one of the bottles to shatter after falling on the gravel.  Having cut my foot to the bone before on broken glass in a lake and not being able to walk right for months after, I'm a little touchy about people being careless with glass, so I went over said, ""Are y'all fucking retarded?  What are you thinking?  Did you not see that happening?""  (sorry for the ""R"" word).  Not the smartest approach, but I was exhausted, feeling horrible, not thinking straight and really just seeing red at that point like I haven't in many years.  One guy looked like he wanted to fight me, and the others weren't obviously happy about it either.  I typically keep a pretty level head in just about every situation but that was just the perfect storm to really send me over the edge.

I did go back and apologize for that, as I did feel bad for reacting like that but man, I'm just so sick of people being completely inconsiderate of others and careless about things.  The older I get the less patience I have for it.  Anyone who's ever shattered glass should also know there's no way you're ever going to get every last little piece of shattered glass out of gravel.  Even on a hardwood floor you need a vacuum cleaner to make sure you get up all the small pieces.  Sooner or later it's going to get turned up, go through someone's tent and into them.",camping

We decided to book a campsite very close to home, and for 3 days - but only go the morning of the 2nd day. That way, we could have full daylight for setup. 

Unfortunately it rained all morning before we left. We decided to still go, even though this was basically a 1 night trip. 

We had no clue how the baby would do. She doesn’t sleep through the night yet. And we said we would leave if she was loud, I didn’t want to disturb any other campers. 

Well, it went pretty great. We had her bundled in a thick sleep sack to stay warm. She woke up at 11 and 4:30 to feed - which I did in the car to muffle any sounds.

308,1696782317.0,Car camping - Planning a bare bones trip,"A friend of mine and I are planning a cold, late October/early November car camping trip.

Here is the problem, I don't have a tent and money is tight. The budget for the trip all in has to be $500CDN between the two of us. The tent has to fit two large men and keep out the worst of the chill. We both have great sleeping bags and sleeping mats. 

I'm going to be spending $40 on wood. I know a place where I can fill my trunk for that amount, good for the 2 nights we plan to spend. I want to keep food and drinks around $75. The less we spend on food the more we can spend on fun. It'll be at least $30 for gas. I'm going to need propane for the stove so that's another $25. Other than that, all of my gear is in good condition. I have extra blankets, clothes and the like to keep warm.

All said, I'm looking at $170CDN in non-negotiable purchases. That leaves $330 for a tent. 

Blessedly, the campsite is a free provincial site up a gravel road. No expenses there.

As far as food is concerned, we're good with eating rice and canned goods for the trip. 

Any help with the budget or recommendations for a decent tent will be much appreciated! 

As far as entertainment, we plan to fish, read, play board games, and listen to music.

343,1696606716.0,Better Hot Water solution for group camping!,"I'll start off by saying I'm an engineer and love solving problems with technical solution, even if there really isn't a ""problem"" to begin with - but if you'll indulge me, I think many folks here will enjoy the discussion and ideas.

Most of my camping is now focused on groups of 20+ people due to my son being in Cub Scouts. It's entirely car-camping based but we often do 2-night campouts. 

The ""problem"" is that kids LOVE hot cocoa, and adults like myself sure enjoy coffee and being able to wash utensils with warm water.

As seen in the attached picture, we have taken to using the orange Igloo drink cooler as a hot water on-tap source. People can make their own tea, coffee, or hot cocoa as desired without having to heat an individual serving.

We heat the water with a propane burner and stock pot, which means we have to pick up a boiling pot and dump it into the cooler periodically. It works, but it's less convenient and I feel like only a matter of time before someone has an accident and douses their feet or legs with 2 gallons of scalding water.

But we're now all accustomed to hot water on demand, so I'm wondering if other people have suggestions, even if I have to make them myself?

Ideally, this solution would be :

1) Propane fired
2) Big enough to hold at least 2 gallons of water hot enough to brew coffee .
3) Insulated so as not to constantly burning fuel.
4) Not require electricity, or running water/water pressure.
5) Not involve manual transfer of boiling water from heater to insulated container 

The best thought I can come up with is using a similar beverage cooler with a coil of copper tubing in an external 'chimney' over a propane burner, that would result in convection circulation. 
But I'm curious if anyone else has ideas. Thanks!",camping

I have a Quechua Air Seconds XL 4.1 (is heavy), and I only use the 4 stakes needed to inflate it and an additional 3 to ensure proper ventilation in the sleeping area. I've never used the other stakes (which I believe are around 8 or 9 more) because I've never seen the need for them, as I've never experienced excessive wind or anything similar.

347,1696582243.0,I just returned from my first solo trip and it was magical!,"6 years ago when I moved to Oz I had never been camping and when my husband brought it up my reaction was,  ""We're going to sleep outside? Why?"" But his family are big campers and it didn't take long to get me to go along. 
 
I have been really run down lately. Work stress, plus I gave up all my leave last year to do end of life care for my husbands grandfather overseas so I haven't had a proper break from work in 2 years.  I had a little leave saved up and I really wanted to so something by myself which my husband fully supported. 

We are lucky to live in the most beautiful place in the entire world, so I don't need to travel far to experience natural beauty.  I chose a camp ground 90 minutes from home because I was familiar with it, and it has full mobile reception which I felt was important on my first trip alone. 

My tent is absolutely enormous because we invested in the oztrail 10 person during the Christmas sales and I don't have a smaller one. It was actually relatively easy to set up on my own! I wanted a bit a glamping feel so I brought along my bedding and a few pretty bits from home.  

The best parts of this site for me are the rock slides, (like a naturally formed waterslide) which I spent an entire morning gleefully riding, and also the rock wallabies. There is a rare species of wallaby that only lives in this small region, and this particular colony is friendly to humans and you can hand feed them. The mothers with joeys are usually more reserved but I went out at dusk and had an incredible interaction with a mama who let me stroke her baby in her pouch while she ate out of my hand!

When I told them they should ask the people who took their spot to move they said they did ask but that the campground booked them both in the same spot. 

When I said ok but you’re not booked here and you need to leave they said no. Sparing you the details but this man was in his briefs the entire time. So foul.

I want to go camping far away from people/anything, have a bit of an adventure. Ideally I get public transport + cycle or public transport + canoe (rent) or something along those lines to get somewhere remote.

365,1696478875.0,How do you FIREPIT?,"My friends and I, we camp all year including in the rain and snow. In bad weather we sit under a tarp.

But there is a problem with sheltering under a tarp and placing the fire OUTSIDE the tarp (which you must do if you like your tarp). The problem is that a circular fire will only warm the 2-3 people who are sitting at the edge of the tarp close to the fire.So, we built a hearth about 5-6 feet wide, alongside the edge of the tarp. We stacked the rocks high at the back and left the front open. The ends of the wall curve inward but then open up to allow more heat to reflect at the ends. It works amazingly. Of course it does require a fair bit of wood because the fire is pretty wide. (See pic)

Another thing we tried recently was to build a platform of stones (about 1 foot high) and then we put our fire on top of the platform. It wasn't a very cold night and it was dry, so we didn't need to think about insulating the heat, etc. This made the fire a little more interactive; the edges of the platform were like a countertop where we could place our foil-wrapped snacks, etc. Also, one corner of the platform was a pretty acute angle, like a spur of stone that you could stand over, with feet on either side, to get REALLY warm.

What have you done to maximize the effectiveness of your hearth build?

436,1696277721.0,"Finding a campsite while hiking on a trail, trouble with undergrowth.","My husband and I just went on our first backpacking hike, and had a lot of trouble finding somewhere to camp for the night. 

We were in Hoosier National Forest, and had an alarm set for 4:30 to start looking for a good site by 5 to give us enough plenty of time to set up camp. We had to settle for a spot that was probably too close to the trail and had to move a bunch of downed wood. On our way out the next day (loop trail) we kept an eye out for future sites, but only saw one ‘maybe’ area. 

The problem is there was a lot of understory of young trees and brambles, and the flexibility of not needing a flat clear spot for a tent (hammock camping) didn’t help much. It’s a shorter trail in terms of backpacking, about 12 miles, but I would have thought there would have been at least one obvious site somewhere on it. 

Is there a trick to finding a spot while hiking or was it just bad luck?",camping

It's going to be pretty primitive, but there will be porta pottys at the campground but no power/running water. I'm just really concerned about my kids being bored.

453,1696234119.0,Camping terminology,"I see the terms “primitive camping” and “dispersed camping” used somewhat often in this sub and am trying wrap my head around what they might mean.

 I am guessing that they are used in the US? 

Can someone define them through descriptions? 

For context, I am Canadian, and these are some terms I use.. (disclaimer there are probably others we use in Canada that I have missed). 

1. Backpacking: Hiking camping while on a trail. Campsites may be designated or not (just a good spot). The land is either a park (Provincial or Federal), or public (Crown).  There is never a picnic table. There might be a tent pad, outhouse, bear box. 

2. Canoe,kayak or bike packing - similar to 1 but on water or by bike. 

3. Car camping: Driving to a designated campground that has designated individual sites. People camp in tents, or may take trailers, RVs or truck & camper combos. 
a) The majority are public: either in parks (provincial or Federal) or around logging leases. Amenities are basic: maybe a few drinking water taps throughout the campground, outhouse toilets, no power or water hook ups. The individual site has a picnic table and fire ring; sometimes a bear box. 
b) There are privately owned ones that have fancier amenities like water and power at each site, buildings with flush toilets and showers.  Sometimes there is a pool and clubhouse. The individual site has at minimum a picnic table and fire ring (to start). 
 
4. Boondocking: Driving out into the bush on a logging or resource road and finding a spot to pull over and camp at. The land is public (crown, or under a logging lease).  Boondockers where I live often seem more likely to have vans or a truck & camper set up than use tents.",camping

528,1695942949.0,Finally Had First Unsafe Outdoors Experience,"Hey campers!

So...it finally happened. Bummer. 

I (usually a tent camper) rented an a-frame for a small, female-only family trip. Two female adults, two female kid/teens. 

I woke up at 3 am to hear what I think was footsteps outside our a-frame. Gahhhhh. I couldn't see out, but the possible intruder could see in because three sides of the a-frame were made of corrugated plastic. 

I was really scared, especially because I had my two beloved nieces and sister in there with me. 

I stayed inside and kept covered up, in hopes that the intruder would not be able to tell the gender or age of the people inside. 

I didn't pick up my cell to call for help,because I didn't want my face to be illuminated or my female voice to be heard. I also didn't have a way to give emergency responders directions to the a-frame since it was accessed via a path in the woods. 

I stayed awake and tried to breathe calmly, reminding myself that the sun would eventually be up and that MOST people do not get killed or attacked when camping. I also reminded myself that the person had not yet seen fit to attempt entering the structure. 

I'm not SURE it was a person out there. It was raining very hard, which sort of obscured the sound, but it really did sound like a human in hiking boots taking a few steps, pausing a while, and continuing to explore the site. This continued for 3.5 hours. 

We had no items of value, so nothing was taken. 

The a-frame was in the back of the owner's farm, so it wasn't another camper at a neighboring site. 

I mentioned this to the owner, and she didn't explain it away as an animal or anything, like ""Oh there are tons of deer. They walk around at night."" She did say she would look around for footprints and that the day after we left, they found a dead/attacked duck on the property. 

I felt so oddly defenseless in there. Any other campers experience this? I would love any safety tips or insight. I

I'll definitely force myself to stay outside again SOON, but I'm definitely open to any tips on how I could have been better prepared to handle this, especially as a female camper. 

Thanks, fellow campers!",camping

532,1695918730.0,Camping & Exploring the California Coast,"Have been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina and finally made it to Southern California.

Henry Miller said that if we are always arriving and departing, it is also true that we are eternally anchored, that one's destination is never a place but rather a new way of looking at things. I return to his writing often in life, but thought about him constantly while cycling the Pacific Coast again. His library in Big Sur was the destination for my first cross-country bike tour ten years ago, but again a precious checkpoint here and now after traveling thousands of miles from the Arctic Ocean to this journey’s dewy, doughy center.

The hardest days collected en route seem to linger with paralytic hypnosis. I lay awake in the tent at night waiting for sleep while reliving these visions of endless gravel lanes through abandoned territories, ice roads crossed over empty tundra, overgrown trail lines connecting nowhere with nothingness. In hindsight those days feel less like a haunting and more of a moveable feast, holy tokens petrified in wayfaring memoriam, voracious days and weeks wrought with depletion, each static horizon barbed by glacial blades and bergs. Cycling in California is much, much easier.

Will the can get hot when I use it?  
Do I have to put out the fire somehow before I turn off the gas, or can I put out the fire by turning off the gas?  

I assume I screw the attachment on: how tight do I screw?

561,1695813577.0,[UK Camping Q] - Government Law or Campsite Law?,"Just to preface this question, its not a caravan/ car camping question per say...  


TL:DR Why are people sleeping in cars 'banned' at campsites?

Hi all,

A group of us are off camping in the Peak District next week, 3 of us are regular campers, but our driver, whilst a competent outdoors person, does not have a tent and would like to sleep in the back of their car (not a van/ caravan etc).

The campsite we are staying at says we can leave the car next to where our tents are pitched, but its strictly prohibited to sleep in the car, even though everyone is paying the full price, per person, per tent, per car etc.

I've never been in a position of needing to know the answer to this, as although I usually have my car, I've always camped in a tent...

However, the campsite owner doesn't seem to have a valid reason as to why this is not allowed AND when I have looked at alterative campsites in the area, they all suggest that its not allowed BUT won't give a satisfactory reason as to why not :/

Is there a reason?

I can only surmise that 'maybe' it has something to do with keeping the engine on? My friend has an EV, but I guess its a blanket ban no exceptions, IF indeed that is the reason? But why not just be transparent about why not?

It wouldn't stand, because the way one  of the poles was ""wonky"" in the side hub. It took the help of many  fellow campers as well as a DNR employee to get the tent to  stand...precariously. At one point we had it rigged with twine to tree  branches up above lol. It was either that or just pack up and go home,  wasting vacation days.

As soon as I  got home I emailed Core about the issue. Adding to my heartbreak, as I  worried would happen, I am out of luck. They told me sorry and to return  to Amazon, but it is past the 30 day return window for that. I'm beyond  frustrated (mostly with myself!).

What  can I do with this tent? I do not want it, will never use it again as I  can't trust it to take camping. I am an older solo camper (with dog)  that can't chance getting somewhere and not being able to set up. Lesson  learned, go with a single-hub tent to lessen chance of issues/easier to  prop up and solve if a hub doesn't work (and lesson learned, set up a  tent the second you get it). I had really wanted this larger tent for  myself so that on rainy days I could have a lot of room to hang out -  but I'm glad at least I wasn't several states from home. Now I know to  stick to a tent I can manage myself should something happen. I know you  can order poles and hubs, but at this point I am not interested in  fixing it (like I said, will never trust a multi-hub now) and I don't  have time to be trying to mess with taking something like this apart.

Anyway  - I don't do Facebook, ebay or any of that sort of stuff to try and  sell it and don't know anyone who would want it, as it's technically  broken. Shipping it would probably cost a small fortune even if I wanted  to give it away online. What would be the best way for me to maybe  donate it somewhere (with the caveat that it's broken and someone handy  would have to fix it first)? I hate to just put it out in my trash,  because I'm sure someone mechanically inclined could fix it up. It's a  beautiful tent (if it worked). Advice?

Also - I did try to post this to CampingGear but it didn't make it past the moderation for some reason.",camping

I'm after a bag intended for comfort in 30-40° overnight temps, so I'm guessing a 0° or -10°F survival rating?

Right now, I'm looking for advice or ways to test/decide which to keep between [Decathalon MT100](https://www.decathlon.com/products/mens-mountain-backpacking-rucksack-50-l-trek-100-easyfit-309807?variant=31629355843646&gclid=CjwKCAjwmbqoBhAgEiwACIjzENA2e5P4gzpeIyYy9wLVY-MSJQ4bpF8yw0ES7mhQdkPZc07e3WXdOhoCAS8QAvD_BwE) vs [Granite Gear Crown 2](https://www.granitegear.com/crown2-60-pack-2769.html) (linked to product page for fyi). I'm new to this and prepping for some day hikes to build into a short 2 day backpacking trip. I plan on doing short backpacking trips (less than 3 days). Price is a non-factor since I got them for roughly the same price. How can I better test which one is for me? What should I consider

&#x200B;

What I've done so far... I loaded each with pillows and weights so each bag is roughly 28lbs. I simulated weight for my gear. I checked that both were comfortable and that I could fit each pack where I have 80% weight on my back and 20% on my shoulders. I walked around for 10 mins with each bag and went up and down stairs.

&#x200B;

So far I know I like both color ways and they're both comfortable from the short testing. I like that the Crown2 is roomier and lighter. I like that the Decathlon has thicker waist bands and shoulder straps. That's not really enough for me to decide yet.",camping

654,1695482559.0,Pop-up tent for early October camping in the UK?," 

Hi all, I'm really excited about planning my first solo camping trip for early October and had a few questions. I'm really excited to get out there and experience nature firsthand. I only have a 3-4 person pop-up tent - would that be suitable for the conditions then, or is there too much risk of rain/wind?

As a first-time solo camper accessing sites by public transport/a short taxi, I don't mind having to change trains a couple of times, but going from bus to train to bus to train isn't really what I'm looking for. What spots would you recommend that are doable without a car? It would also be nice if there was a pub or small restaurant nearby in case the weather gets too bad - I know, I know, having a backup warm meal option is ""half ass camping"" for you veterans out there, but hey, it's my first time so cut me some slack! I'd love to find a more remote wooded area if possible for the full camping experience, including hopefully getting to warm up around a little fire in the evenings and enjoying the beauty of it getting dark early, settling into my tent with a good book while listening to the sounds of the woods. Nothing like warming up over a little fire, ey?

Additionally, as an inexperienced camper, are there any small, low-cost items I should bring that could make a big difference in comfort? I'm planning on really bundling up in my sleeping bag, but open to any other tips.

With budget and size being a consideration when using public transit, any advice on items that should be prioritised or deprioritised in my packing based on typical October weather?

Lastly, how likely is it I'd run into other campers that late/early in the season? I don't mind being somewhat secluded, but it would be nice to have others nearby just in case. I'm also curious about the rules around extending stays if enjoying my first trip. Like hypothetically, since i know farmers don't really care if you wild camp on their land, would the manager/staff approach me to leave if I overstayed my pitch by a day or two?

Any advice from any level of camping expierience is greatly appreciated! I'm determined to get out there via public transport, but I want to plan carefully since I'm new to camping solo. Let me know your thoughts!

655,1695480793.0,Anyone else have an experience like this?,"So the wife and I were camping at a State park campground on the lake.  Just the two of us and our pup.  We took the canoe out for a cruise and while out a storm was rolling in.  As we rowed back up to the site our neighbor was in our site moving our stuff around.  He looked up saw us and asked if we had our pup.  I told him yes while looking at him like why are you around my stuff.  He said he noticed the storm coming and didn't want our stuff to get wet and proceeded back to his site....  Nothing was missing and he seemed to genuinely just putting our stuff away.  We even had a few conversations with the guy and his family afterwards.  It just took me back because I would never have thought to move someone's things out of the rain.  I was always in the mind set you leave your stuff out then you know what could happen to it.  Any thoughts???


Edit to original post. I have been camping since I was a kid for 30+ years and this was the first time I have had this happen. I was definitely appreciative afterwards but was surprised someone was on our site initially. 

Also the only thing out was the pups bed.  We have learned over the years to secure all our crap lol. I think it's our dog before we had her people never spoke to us... 😂😂😂",camping

After checking out their website and liking what I saw, I decided to reach out to the store owner and haggle for a better deal. He ended up giving me a substantial discount but asked me to pick it up from their warehouse, conveniently located nearby. Once I got back home, I wasted no time setting up the RTT. I then took my son on a two-day adventure to West Virginia to give it a test run. I must say, it exceeded my expectations overall.

Next up, I'm planning a solo camping trip for approximately a month. During this extended camping adventure, I realized that I might need to conduct some additional tests and preparations. I'm eager to learn what steps to take to ensure the RTT's reliability and my safety in this situation. I'm also contemplating whether I need to stock up on specific equipment or resources to handle various potential challenges.

658,1695460216.0,Thank you for not being these campers. Seriously.,"Hey all you beautiful campers! I wanted to say thank you to all of the amazing people on here who are fabulous at sharing the outdoors with others. We just got back from 1 week at our favorite local state campground we go to instead of therapy. I feel like I need therapy now because of it.

It's finally the time of year you can be one of the only people in campgrounds here. I made reservations a few months ago, which everyone can see online when campsites are taken on what dates, right?

Enjoying the peaceful forest, we're the only ones there for a week, out of 60 sites. What a stellar week! But NO...a family of screaming kids has to pull in RIGHT NEXT TO US.  Can anyone tell me why people do this? I have the same reaction when I'm in an empty restaurant and someone comes in and sits right next to me. Maybe I need to be less introverted.

Anyway, while one kid is carrying a Bluetooth speaker and blasting music at 5 million decibels right next to our car in our site, another one starts hacking at the old oak trees with a machete....and then starts chasing squirrels with it while screaming. And then starts eyeing our two little dogs. I asked the parents as nicely as possible to put their wild primates in check, and they told me to go fuck myself. When the kids started throwing gravel at our car and the ""adults"" thought it was cute while they threw another beer can in the bushes, I called the ranger. They actually kicked them out double time. But we ended up leaving that evening because they knew where we were, and I'm feeling paranoid.

So, to all of you pleasant, ettiquette-minding campers, a great big THANK YOU.

Edit: Thanks everyone for making me feel like I'm not hypercritical :D. I should also add that they didn't have a reservation (I checked the website too) but they drove around and looked at all the sites first. We always keep our dogs quiet and set up a dog fence around our seating area as well, don't play music etc. I was half joking about camping for therapy...but we are both first responders and quiet camping time is really important, which is why when we go to actual campgrounds we go in the off season or check the availability maps. I realize people and kids make noise...but this felt like it was going to turn into The Hills Have Eyes kind of crap.",camping

661,1695436873.0,What are some cool / funny / otherwise positive or uplifting stories you have from camping?,"Feels like this subreddit has been a hotbed of straight up negativity recently with all of the etiquette arguments and whatnot so lets flip the script.  What are some really nice/friendly/wholesome experiences you've had with your neighbors and fellow campers over the years?

tldr: old lady recently widow(er?)ed is nice to us and everyone has a nice experience

I have a ton but one that always sticks in my mind despite being well over 20 years ago was camping at a little campground in WNC by a river.  Pit toilet, not a lot of sites, pretty out of the way in a national forest.  I was probably like 10 or 11 at the time and when we showed up there was nobody else there at all. We took a really sweet site by the river and got situated etc.

A few hours later a probably 70+ old lady with a little 80s pop up camper trailer and extremely nice sweet old grandma energy shows up and pulls up by our site and in a totally non grumpy way exclaims ""yall took my favorite spot!"" which makes sense because it was a really great spot.  She asked us if we minded helping her back her trailer in to the adjacent site because her husband had recently passed and this was her first time out at their favorite campground since.  My dad backed her trailer in and we went back to doing our own thing.

A few hours later she comes over and invites us over for dinner which was pork and beans.  She had an absolutely huge pot of beans and probably like a dozen hot dogs cut up into it which I remember being amused by considering she was just one little old lady but I guess she was hoping for some company.  We accepted even tho we already had eaten and hung out at her site with her for a while, she kinda just seemed like she wanted to talk to people and was sweet as can be.  I remember thinking she reminded me exactly of my grandmother who was your typical sweet old rural Alabama old lady.  

She ended up telling us about how she and her late husband had been going to this pretty out of the way campground for the last 40 years or something (since 1959 or some shit) and had a ton of stories about it etc.  The one I remember is her talking about a flash flood on the river (this campground was in a valley along a river) with some kid about my age probably 30 years previous fishing on the river and her husband basically running down and grabbing him up before the water got too high since the kid didn't realize the gravity of what was going on.  She said the flood came up the banks and wiped out all of the lower few sites along the river in a matter of like 10 minutes.

We probably spent an hour with this lady tops but it was just such a friendly and wholesome interaction that I still think about it in my mid 30s despite this probably being late 90s or so.  She came by a few more times to thank us again for helping her out with the trailer and stuff.  I like to think we made her weekend a little better because she really seemed like she needed some human interaction (judging thru my adult lens of what I was largely unconcerned with at the time as a 10 year old who mostly just wanted to go move rocks around in the river).

Bonus story: much more recently I was camped next to some old graybeard motorcycle dudes with choppers, an American flag on a pole they literally planted into the dirt in their campsite etc, Vietnam vets I think.  My brother and I were walking down to the creek to try to catch some trout, they yelled something like good luck as we walked past.  As luck would have it we pretty much immediately caught a decent trout big enough to eat so we were walking back with a good sized trout all of 20 mins later to cook up.  Dudes were so pumped about this (they were deep in drink at this point despite it being about 3 in the afternoon) they practically lobbed a few beers at our head so we brought them over some of the trout snack after we cooked it up on a plank by the fire

1st, My fairly large four-person didn't have enough room for all of my stuff which needed to stay out of frost and dew.

2nd, I froze to death even in a 0º bag and a ton of wool blankets. (I'm very cold blooded and have a hard-enough time staying warm in the summer haha)

So I bought a massive cabin-tent for way more space to store my gear and my friend's gear in one of the partitions, and a Buddy Indoor-Safe propane heater to warm up the other partition for sleeping. **The problem is,** the entire roof of the tent is mesh, with only the rainfly about 6-8"" off the top of the tent.

I went to cabelas and bought the ascend-lightweight-cot-blue. More than I planned to spend but it was what was avaliable and had a good return policy. I’ve fallen in love. It packs down super small and is very light. It’s light to the point I would backpack with it. 

Issue is, while I work I’ve noticed it makes my dog very happy. I want to get him a cot for camping. But I also want it to be light and packable. 

Only reason I wouldn’t buy a second one is price, at some point I can eat that cost but curious if anyone has a good packable dog cot that would fit for him coming to work with me and would also be used in our big tent. 

He can very much sleep on the floor, he’s just so damn happy in my cot.

763,1695122141.0,"Secluded, easy to access, hiking and camping in North Carolina????","I am planning to take my boyfriend on a camping/ hiking trip for his birthday this year within the next couple of months. We do this every year but have never been to North Carolina.

We aren’t frequent campers, but I have been to  multiple campsites over the course of me life. We typically go to a campsite for this trip, but they are never secluded and don’t have easy access to hiking trails. I am looking for areas/ locations in North Carolina that we can drive into easily (with a Kia Soul… sorry) that are pretty secluded and within walking distance of some hiking trails. The idea is to pull in and set up, hang out for a day, go hiking the next, and then leave the 3rd day. I just don’t want to have to pack up and drive to a hiking trail and I want to make sure it is accessible as well as secluded.


Edit: I am not looking for campgrounds. I want to virtually see no one",camping

817,1694930593.0,DIY 12v battery shower,"Hi all

I just finished making my own 12 volt completely portable battery powered shower.

It is made from the following parts:

- 20L plastic jerry can
- 12V camp shower kit
- a battery clip to suit Milwaukee 18V M18 battery
- an 18V to 12V DC converter
-12V push button switch
- some 3mm acrylic sheet bent into a gear tray
- neoprene adhesive sealant gasket tape

I cut a large hole in the top so the submersible pump would  fit in. Then I drilled some holes for the nylon compression glands to reticulate the shower hose and pump cable out of.

Next I cut & moulded the piece of acrylic which would act as a gear tray to mount the electrics, as well as a removable cover for the hole so that the pump can be removed for repair or replacement.

I mounted and wired up the switch, battery clip, and DC converter.

All new penetrations through the jerry can have been sealed with neoprene gasket material.

It is not 100% waterproof but it is waterproof enough that it won't spill water in your vehicle on a rough trail, as long as it stays right way up.

To use it, all you need to do is boil some water to add to the cold water inside, plug in a charged Milwaukee M18 battery onto the red clip, carry to where you want to use it, and press the button to operate the pump.

I also have a drop down table on my Jeep tailgate so I leave the jerry can in the rear of the Jeep and use it for washing dishes etc after cooking. 

I think all up it cost me about $100 AUD (roughly $65 USD). It was quite an easy project with just a drill, Dremel, soldering iron, heat gun to bend the plastic and heat shrink wires, and basic hand tools needed.",camping

848,1694814665.0,A Sleeping Pad That Doesn't Deflate,"Ladies and Gentleman,

Over the course of 15 years of camping, cycling, hiking and being outdoors most of the time. I have yet to encounter a blow up sleeping pad that has not, at some point, failed. I do not even recall the names of these sleeping pads at this juncture.

As I lay, on yet another dying pad, I think to myself. Gee, I might be getting up there in the high end price range where maybe it's worth investing in a quality grade sleeping mat. However, I am still of the opinion, and I think of this in many respects of my life, IT WILL BREAK. No matter what. 

Has anyone ever made it through more than, sheesh, idk, 2 years with the same sleeping pad? With no holes? And using it regularly?

I'm actually going on a YEAR with a PowerLux Dumb Pad, and it was the longest running one I've ever had. However, after starting a bicycle trip; I'm two months into a trip from Nordkapp, Norway to Cape Town, South Africa, I have yet another casualty of the open road. Sport Outlets in Norway have essentially the same pad for roughly $20-$30 and I'm thinking about doing that again. Or submerging the pad in the pond I'm sleeping next to tonight and finding the hole..

876,1694728297.0,How to still enjoy camping when the isolation and silence is gone?,"Hello, everyone.

I'm a long time camper, hiker and general outdoorsy person. Part of what I used to enjoy the most about the outdoors was just getting away from people and noise. I am fairly introverted person, so I just feel like I need to get away from people, noise and busy city life in order to recharge myself. Unfortunately, that is just rarely the case anymore. It just seems every year that outdoors hobbies, especially camping, just keep increasing in popularity. I started noticing the popularity increase a bit before COVID and it just sky rocketed after COVID, at least where I like to go (west Texas, east and north New Mexico and all over Arizona). Having read similar stories here and other subs, I know I'm not the only one experiencing this.

Anyway, in an effort to experience quiet and isolation again, I have been trying to get more and more remote and off trail. It is definitely better, but I still encounter people and often obnoxious ones (from my view point anyway). For example, I tried to take up dispersed camping recently, which is less crowded for sure, but it's not an escape. The last night of my most recent dispersed camp, a couple of dudes should up at like 9 pm and were making tons of noise setting up while talking and laughing loudly. While not ideal, I can overlook that. Unfortunately, they started playing extremely loud music (like small concert loud) at 10:30 pm. From what I have been reading on this sub lately, it seems like a lot of people are experiencing similar or worse including theft and threatening behavior while dispersed camping.

So, long story short, I have accepted that I can't escape people or noise anymore. That's just the current reality. However, I would still like to enjoy the outdoors. My question for all the other campers out there is have you found a way to to still enjoy camping without the quiet and isolation? This question is specifically for people who enjoy the isolated and quiet aspect of camping. I get noise and people don't bother many of you. For those who like the quiet, how have you continued to enjoy the outdoors with the quiet gone (if it has gone away like it has for me)?

Edit: Going more remote hasn't helped as I mentioned, so that's why I'm asking how people still have fun camping when it's not quiet. I have accepted people will always be present

Edit 2: I'm not complaining. I fully understand we ""share"" the outdoors with other people. I have never asked anyone I have encountered to leave, to keep quiet or been rude to them in any way. Like I said, I have accepted people will always be around. I want to continue enjoying the outdoors despite that.

Edit 3: Once again, I have gone dispersed camping and tried going more remote. People still show up. Not to mention seedy activity goes on at dispersed campsites as others have mentioned. The southwest US seems to have become very popular. Why? I don't know. I guess the southwest is hot right now (no pun intended). Anyway, that's why I am not asking how to find more quiet, just how to still enjoy the outdoors with people present. Regardless, thanks for all the helpful ideas. Backpacking is definitely a consideration of mine but it is time consuming, and I don't have a lot of gear and can't afford to buy a lot of gear. Still willing to try it out if I can get my wife onboard. Weekday camping is also definitely a consideration but both my wife and I work day jobs and we don't get a ton of leave time. It's hard for us just to take a week off and disappear. If we can though, I'm sure we will find more peace and quiet. I will also try checking out other states like Utah, Nevada, California etc. Again, getting the time off is an issue though. I will also give Hicamp a look.

884,1694704892.0,Can you help us grasp how windspeed (~15mph) translates to force on tents and canopies?,"We’re heading to a festival in Mass this weekend, about 80 miles east of Boston. Weather Underground is predicting 10 – 16 mph winds but no rain.  I've never really looked at wind speeds in isolation, so I don't have a concept of how numbers translate to lived experience.   

We have a basic 6-person Coleman tent and a 13' pop-up. 

The tent gets staked down at all points and has done us well thus far in a few heavyish storm, but again I have nothing to compare it to (i.e. was that “wow, that was windy!” a 5 mph or 15 mph situation?). 

The pop-up takes two stakes per leg. In rainstorms, we pull the corner canopy extensions (the short poles that expand the canopy from 10' to 13') and drop the legs down so it's about four feet off the grown rather than fully up. 

None of that protects from other canopies or tents that have taken flight, of course. 

Are 15 mph winds likely to wreak havoc across the festival? A few lost tents and whatnot here and there but generally just very gusty? 

We usually stake so the stake angle is either opposite the rope it's holding (i.e. so it forms an acute angle between the rope and the ground) and in two different angles in each pop-up leg. Any advice on improving that? 

Lastly, since we're going to be staking the heck out of things, any advice on how to get those straight stakes (the ones with a slightly larger top, not with a hook to it) out of the ground when it's time to go? They're usually difficult, but I imagine over-securing things is likely to make it a nightmare to pull them up, especially those that are flush with the metal legs of the pop-up.

907,1694628305.0,New to camping. Just sayin’ hi.,"
Hey all, new to camping but me and my partner are really looking forward to getting into it. I bought a Basecamp 6 tent from REI (half price, baby!) and I’m slowly sourcing gear. My goal is to go camping next (late) spring for the first time. We live in Rhode Island so I’m thinking our maiden trip will be in New England. 

For our first few trips, we’d like to car camp on a campground. That way, we can work out the kinks and figure out what we need and what we don’t need. Our preference would be for camp sites that are somewhat isolated from each other, but with access to bathrooms/showers. 

I have heard of a few campgrounds that only allow tents. There’s something I like about that. We don’t have kids so playground amenities or “entertainment” really isn’t exciting to us. We’re going to have some peace and quiet, with a few comforts and luxuries.  

After that, we’d like to really see what is out there for camping. I think we’d both like to see a mixture of different camping experiences like backpack camping, disperse camping, and hot tent camping. 

So far I’ve been bringing myself up to speed by watching YouTube videos on different things to keep in mind, types of gear, etc. and though I really like watching, I am going to have a ton of questions. That’s why I want to say hi to all you awesome people. 😀",camping

909,1694625744.0,Question about dew and bugs - tentless camping in 60°F weather,"I just finished building a big playset for my kids ([this is it](https://i.imgur.io/FkthxGo_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium), I know I still have to finish one level, I'm going to finish it at a later date), and I told my kids when it was done we would camp out on it. It seemed like a fun thing to do, and they're excited about it. Now that it's almost time to do (we are doing it this Friday night), I'm starting to think about the logistics of it and worrying myself a bit haha

With it being on the playset, we obviously can't do a tent, so I planned on just putting a pad down and sleeping in a tent under the stars. But I'm wondering how the dew and bugs will affect us. I live in Kentucky near the woods, for the record. The bugs currently are a pain during the day, but at dusk they seem to chill out, but I don't know if they will start bugging (excuse the pun) us after we stop moving, and not sure if bug spray alone will do the trick.

As far as dew goes, the ground definitely gets wet, but if we are elevated 5-10 feet (depending on which floor we are sleeping on), will that still be an issue? If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it. I want it to be fun, and I don't want my poor kids to wake up wet and full of bug bites!",camping

911,1694623246.0,Walking through your camp,"TLDR: guy walks through my campsite to fish and says I'm the asshole when I tell him it is rude.

I want to check to see if I was rude in this situation.   The other day I was at a BLM campsite.  This spot has 4 camp sites, they are quite obvious from a fireplace and stone picnic table.  Since this location is by a river two of the camp spots have little paths people have picked through to get to the water.  One path is roughly 10-15 feet long and the other is about 35ft long.  There is also a boat ramp with extra parking right by the bathroom.

I got there super early and picked one of the camp spots with water access.  It was the edge of a hill, the picnic table, about 3 ft from that the firepit, then 4 ft from that my truck bed.  So i was in the spot and relatively compaxt.  I was in camp putting a few things in the truck about to walk the dog when all of a sudden a big yellow lab comes walking into my camp.  Right after that a guy comes up and goes we are just going to the fishing spot.  He walks right past me, between the fire pit and my truck, then to the path that leads to the water.  I was kind of dumbstruck but still took my dog on a walk.  A minute later I saw his friend and asked to confirm.   I told him it was quite rude to walk through a camp spot to fish.  He said they would watch out but then when I got to camp it was obvious he had went through it to go meet his buddy.

A little later the original guy came through and basically said I was wrong for saying it was rude.  I told him he can't just walk through a camp site, one that is at a designated spot, when somebody is there.  I told him it was extremely rude and asked what if my dog was the aggressive type?  He tried to say he was a local so that's what they do but I don't quite believe that part.  He also hinted that if he didnt have his 2 year old strapped to his chest there would be a fight.  I've camped around the country and never had somebody do this.

To add one more piece of information, his friend didn't come back through my camp.  There was a larger, recreation area 125 yards down the road.  In the river they were literally closer to the water access at that recreation area and not the camping area so his friend exited that way.

So basically, am I an asshole or am I right in thinking that guy was full of shit and rude for doing that?",camping

914,1694619887.0,Older Clip Flashlight 2-Person Tent Question,"I just picked up an old(er) Clip Flashlight 2-person tent because it's exactly what I was looking for and since it was older/used it didn't break the budget at all.

I set it up in my yard. I put down a cheap ground tarp and set the tent up on top of it - then sprayed it down with a hose to check if it was leaky or needed some waterproofing / resealing. The fly seemed to be waterproof - but there was some pooling coming from the floor. I don't know a lot about tents; can this be solved by 're water proofing' this or have I wasted my money?

Since the tarp extended beyond the fly, the water was caught and 'pooled up' directly under the tent, which may have been part of the reason - but I would figure the base of most tents should be able to hold up to something like that, no?

Is there another test I can try? I just want to make sure I don't wake up soaked if it rains while I'm using this tent :) 

Any advice appreciated.

915,1694618527.0,At what point is fellow campers being loud in the middle of the night too much?,"First time poster here, not sure if this is the right place for this maybe more of a rant to get it off of my chest. I've camped allot in my life and allot more in the last year or 2, more or less full-time over the last 6 months due to life circumstances, maybe I've just been able to avoid people that much that I've never had an issue with noisy neighbors but this current spot Im at has a couple that seemingly stays up the entire night talking and laughing, they rolled in Monday morning at 4am slamming doors & yelling at each other. Woke up around 3am this morning to them laughing at the top of their lung, talking loudly, Tiktok blaring and they didnt quiet down until 5 and then right back at it around 6. 

It's dispersed camping so sure there really aren't any rules but I think its common decency to be quiet at those hours. Half asleep after listening to them for an hour I sat up and yelled out ""Hey, shut the f up"" twice but they either didn't hear me or didnt care. Walked over this morning mostly to apologize for yelling out at them, everyone I've met at this spot has been overly friendly so I thought it might just be a chance to strike up a conversation but the guy wasn't having it so I just asked kindly to keep it down at night, this guys partner jumps out of the car like a rabid dog ""nobody gives an f, we dont care about your sleep nobody gives an f I'm gonna run you over with my car"", I had to have had my mouth agape I was just shocked like wtf...

Unfortunately in Belgium pouches with fish (or chicken) is almost nowhere to be found.

938,1694548719.0,Coleman Carlsbad review,"
I purchased the Coleman Carlsbad 4 person tent for use camping at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival this past weekend. For those who don't know, it ended up a shit show, one of the major problems being a massive out of nowhere spinoff storm that did a ton of damage to tents cars and canopies. 

I initially bought this tent because I liked the screened in porch, and I figured the darkroom technology would be useful in case we wanted to sleep in a little bit after long nights without the sun shining in our faces. That feature did turn out to be the second best aspect of the tent - not because of the sun, but because we ended up being camped directly underneath one of those massive generator lights. It was like camping beneath a mini sun, but yet when we crawled into bed each night, you'd never know the blazing glow of the only thing that worked at that festival was there. 

The best feature was by far the waterproofing. If you've seen some reviews saying the screened in area is not at all waterproof, those complaints are definitely true. It could use some additional setup to help keep some of the water out, but it was perfect for leaving our already wet clothes, and honestly having a slight second layer of security to the tent opening setup. Beyond the porch layer of the tent though, the waterproofing was phenomenal. Neighbors all around us were blowing out of the ground and flooding and some were literally flying through the air, but not the Coleman Carlsbad. We stayed dry, even *with the windows open* at times. We didn't even have a tarp layer down under the tent.

Additional perks: the pockets on the back side were super handy and nicely sized for storing everything from water bottles and charging phones to medications, and the top hook was perfect to add a light and fan for the heat. We didn't end up using the screened in area (see: rain and also 7' tall friend who wouldn't fit) but it would have been great if there were bugs and better weather. My husband did end up taking a nap in there on one of the drier days lol. 

Cons: I really don't have a lot of complaints, but one thing I will say is the entrance to the screened in area definitely needs a way to be staked down in the middle, because otherwise you need two hands to get out and idk about y'all but I don't have the brain power to use both hands at 7am.

Recommendations: I would definitely recommend a tarp under the tent and an additional rain fly setup for the screened in area if you're anticipating wet weather and want that part to be dry. I would also recommend heavier duty tent stakes - while the majority of the stakes we used held up to the rain and wind of the storms (only one came out and it probably wasn't in right), a number of them bent as we tried to stake the tent down (which is probably why the one wasn't in right), so honestly we're definitely springing for something larger and stronger next time.

Overall, 9.5/10 for the Coleman Carlsbad, I may never buy another tent again",camping
