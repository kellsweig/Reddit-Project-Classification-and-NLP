0,1695327383.0,How to use filters on /r/bouldering,"Hi Boulderers,

It's been a while since we have re-implemented flairs on this subreddit, and from a mod perspective things seem to be going well.

I realize not everyone is familiar with how flairs work on reddit or what you can do with them, so I thought I would put a few helpful tips up.

# First of all, what is flair?

Link flairs are basically tags that can be used to sort content on reddit. Adjacent to the title of the post on /r/bouldering you should see a brightly colored label, with some white writing on it. On new reddit they look like this:

https://preview.redd.it/aq4mcpt3lnpb1.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=02473d5ce85f83ea5efff931f227159ea039bdb6

Flairs are assigned by the creator of a particular post. They are able to flair it with whatever flair they like, but mods will override incorrect flairs.

When you click on a flair in the sidebar, your feed will be ordered something like this:

https://preview.redd.it/ahzajb9ulnpb1.png?width=1667&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f593b5e1739a655e4c65cae1fd47453b407f1d

You can do with any of the flairs in the sidebar. If you click on the flair next to any of the posts, you will get the same result (this is how you do it on old reddit too, or you can just get reddit enhancement suite and it will do the filtering natively.)

In addition, you will note that the URL has changed. Before it just said, ""[https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering""](https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering/?f=flair_name%3A%22Question%22) but now it says, ""[https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering/?f=flair\_name%3A%22Question%22](https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering/?f=flair_name%3A%22Question%22)""

If you play around with the URL you can make it do interesting things. For example if you want to EXCLUDE all question flairs, simply add a ""-"" (minus symbol) in front of the word ""flair"" and all question flairs will be omitted from the results. The URL would look like this: [https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering/?f=-flair\_name%3A%22Question%22](https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering/?f=-flair_name%3A%22Question%22) and the results would look like this:

https://preview.redd.it/3u8byaxsmnpb1.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=a941f697677b9d5e36478638b8f35a667741a3e6

Another thing you can do with the URL is to combine requests. So for example say you want to omit all questions, injuries, and shoe posts. The URL would look like this: [https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering/?f=-flair\_name%3A%22Question%22%20OR%20-flair\_name%3A%22Shoes%22%20OR%20-flair\_name%3A%22Injuries%22](https://new.reddit.com/r/bouldering/?f=-flair_name%3A%22Question%22%20OR%20-flair_name%3A%22Shoes%22%20OR%20-flair_name%3A%22Injuries%22) which would leave you with just Advice/Beta Requests, Indoor, Outdoor, and Information flairs.

I suggested offhandedly we could do it as our first date and here we are.

I would say I’m relatively fit, I used to play a lot of basketball, now more boxing and working out. But I’m not sure what the nuances are for bouldering. I’ve watched a few videos but obviously nothing beats actual experience.

It's the ideal setting anyone who watches climbing videos could hope for: 4 climbers who are amongst the very best, engaging in a friendly comp with each other, each setting a boulder that hopefully favours themselves more than their competition. And all attempts are filmed clearly and fully (except maybe the 2nd attempts on problem 4), you barely don't miss a thing.

9,1697437319.0,First comp - so much fun!,"This weekend I took part in my first competition in the social category (just for laughs really) and I had an absolute blast. I climbed harder than I've ever climbed before, more than 48 hours later I'm still sore! But no regrets, I'll absolutely be doing it again.

I ended up coming in 2nd in that category, but the competitor ahead of me has an entry on the IFSC website (albeit with no new entries in 9 years), so it kind of feels like 1st place.

I've been climbing regularly for about a year and a half now, and at 48, I'm not expecting to improve to the point of being able to enter the proper comp next year, but who knows, if I get a bit of coaching and keep seeing my physio and improving my mobility, maybe I'll give it a shot. Either way I'll be in there again having fun.

This vid is of my second attempt of my favourite boulder of the session. I sent my 3rd attempt but my buddies had moved on so no footage of that unfortunately. :( It's not very clean, I tend to power through and take advantage of my height (as my friend commented ""he's just so long!) 🤣",bouldering
10,1697480091.0,Finger injury diagnosis,"Hello internet doctors. So today I hurt my middle finger whilst bouldering. Heard a pop in my hand, finished the climb and when I got down I noticed my finger really hurt. Tried another boulder but realised I should stop. When I curl up my finger and push on my finger tip it hurts the most. Pushing on the middle part of my finger also hurts, kind of like pushing on a bruise. Luckily it isn't swollen. 

So after some googling, I think I have a finger pulley injury. Though most pages say it takes 2-6 months to recover. This seems kind of odd to me because it feels like I will be able to climb again this week or next week.

This also prevents me from trying anything remotely challenging, feels like im gonna rip my Forearms off.

25,1697388453.0,Is my gym abnormal? How to build community?,"I go to a bouldering gym in area of about 60k people. It's the only climbing gym I've been a member of. I really enjoy climbing as an activity but the community aspect is lacking. The problem is just there aren't many ""regulars."" I have made friends with the few there are and have gone on trips with them which has been great but if I show up on my own it's not uncommon for me to be the only person in the gym. I'll see someone once or twice and then never see them again. Even the owners have complained to me about this. It seems the gym is staying afloat from day passes and birthday parties. 

Some of the benefits to bouldering are that you can just show up and climb whenever but that also limits the communal aspect I feel. Other things like swim/run/bike groups, crossfit, bjj etc have a set workout schedule and that, for better or worse, makes people attend at a certain time so it builds consistency. I know I'm not forced to climb or anything but I do enjoy it - I just wish there was a little more community like other things I've been done. Life is short and if I'm going to devote so much time to something why not have it be more social? So, any suggestions? The owners are pretty receptive to ideas. I don't know, maybe the fact that it's a somewhat rural area there's not much that can be done.",bouldering
26,1697407426.0,Weird sensation after climbing…,"I’ll try and explain this as best I can!
Has anyone else experienced an uncontrollable arm jerk for like half a second when lifting say a glass to drink from or picking up a plate from a shelf? This happens quite often after I climb. Not an injury and doesn’t hurt but is a tad annoying - have spilt a few drinks on me due to it.
Best way I can describe is my arm jerks up or down slightly and I get a short moment of weakness - normally the feeling is in the outer side of the shoulder at the top of the arm. Any ideas or people experiencing similar?

Edit - Seems like it’s a muscle twitch from overloading - thanks for all the replies, prompted me to do a better search of conditions using doctor google and it correlates. Probably just went a bit hard today 😅 thanks again!",bouldering

34,1697332270.0,Advice for a friend,"Throwaway as to justify fake details:

I (20 something male) have a friend (older 20 something male) and we both wanted to do something to keep us both fit. He's  on the heavier side and I'm more on the lighter side but we just want to be fit.  We decided to use a groupon to go climbing at a local gym and have since picked up memberships. 

It was our third visit together and we went during a particularly busy time at the gym. There were a couple of problems that we were attempting and by the time he was attempting one a crowd had formed at the area where we were climbing. He basically completed the climb but when he was hanging off of the last hold in victory the hold shifted (not to a dangerous point but still significantly). He was mortified because everyone watching let out a collective wince and I tried helping calm him down becuase we've seen others accidentally shift holds.

But lately I've been asking him to climb together and he doesn't really want to. He mentioned something about trying to drop pounds a little more intensely so he wanted to look at more HIIT based workouts. I have a feeling that it also has to deal with the climbing hold shifting with a lot of people watching. I didn't tell him this but I saw him in the bathroom trying to take a deep breath as he stared at his stomach.

I guess my question is, what do I say to my friend to help him assuage his anxieties going back to the gym? Climbing is meant to be welcoming and that experience didn't help assuage his fears.

I got the wood for the outer frame for free from the company I work at, haven't seen anyone else using wood this wide (10x10 cm) but it really gives a very solid feel when climbing. I included 2 of them at the bottom of the wall to make as much use of it Nd set some foot holds. The frame of the wall itself is made with more standard wood (4.5x9.5 cm) and plywood is 15 mm thick, unfortunately couldn't get my hands on 17 mm one where I live (based in Sweden). It seems to hold very well but if anyone has had bad experiences with it I would appreciate some input!
The wall is relatively small compared to what I have seen around, 193x163.5 cm, but still possible to set a few different routes and enjoy some variety. When looking around for information most people said that it wasn't worth it to build anything shorter than 220 cm, so I just want to show other people with limited space that it's possible and still very enjoyable!
If anyone is interested I can send more detailed info, costs and pictures of the building process and climbing vids 🙂 
Also worth mentioning, this wall was built using very basic tools (basically a handsaw and an old drill), so no one should get discouraged for not having the fanciest equipment. It would have been much faster, well polished and easier to work though 😂

This is with regular 2 days minimum and 5 days max (years ago) training/climbing. Always trying to push the next sport grade or boulder. Not punting or being half arsed.

For example, worked a local f7A+ boulder around 30 session, only got just over half way through the traverse before the rain shut it down for the winter.

101,1697200426.0,Shoe Advice Appreciated,"Hi, I am new to the sub so apologies if I do or say anything incorrect.

I have been bouldering for maybe a year (inconsistently), have had some hand me down shoes that don’t fit me (toes don’t touch the ends) and am currently consistently climbing V4s. I know it’s nothing crazy, but I feel my shoes are pulling and moving around way to much when I climb, especially when it comes to very small foot holds. Of which I can’t quite use my toes to the fullest as my shoe slides out, or I can’t plant my foot due to the leftover room.

My foot is kind of weird. I have Roman feet that are also quite narrow with I believe a normal / medium arch so have been struggling to find shoes that fit me well. 

The main kinds of shoes I tried were very aggressive, (Tenaya, Scarpa, La Sportiva) as I felt I wanted to go that way. But for the shoes I did try there was either way too much pain than I believe is necessary, or too much dead space in the toe area.

I’m making this post asking anyone for recommendations for me as I am having a tough time. Thank you very much for any help, apologies for the wall of text I probably overshared a bit.

Lastly I should have mentioned I am an indoor boulderer, having only out door bouldered once, but might plan on doing it sometime in the future. But for the most part, indoors is for me.

Whenever I lock off and have to hold a position with my right arm I get this shoulder pain immediately after releasing the tension.   
The pain feels as if it is inside the shoulder and only lasts for 5-10 seconds but is kinda sharp, and I can feel that as I progress during the training session my shoulder becomes weaker and weaker and the pain becomes stronger. To the point I can't do lockoffs with the right arm at all after an hour of climbing. The pain dissapears after these 10 seconds after the lockoff and I have no problem when freely moving my arm, there is no pain or mobility issues.  
 There is no pain at all during the day, unless I flex my shoulder really hard.  
Also There is no such problem at all with my left shoulder only the right shoulder.

I keep trying to find some good times and days to go, just to find out some event that's not on the calendar, or not organized by the gym, is going on; at least I can't think of any other justification for 1-2 dozen people to all show up within 30 minutes of each other. I get it like, 5:30pm on a weeknight is going to be a busy time...the gym is gonna run events and clubs, etc etc but I've tried a pretty good smattering of times, I check the calendar before I go, and I seem to run into this problem maybe 3/5 times I go to the gym. 

I also get being an introvert in a social sport is gonna cause problems, but sometimes these events (or whatever the hell these sudden crowds are) are crazy. Last week people were running laps in groups. Just close your eyes and imagine what that looks like in a small climbing gym. People running up just to campus random holds right below where I'm trying to climb. I really try my best to just pick a spot and tunnel vision and get my work out done but I feel like I have to keep eyes in the back of my head because 18 thousand people are just running all over the place. Crowds aren't usually a problem, but sometimes they are it's a problem.

Let's assume that I can't just up and find a new gym. What's the move here? I'm trying to be positive and solution-oriented but it's really starting to fuck up my vibe and cut my work outs short. Do I have an attitude problem? Do I need to become a morning person? Do I need to get a crew so I can carve out a spot in this unpredictable gym?

Hey everyone! 🧗🏼‍♂️👋

I've seen posts here discussing various methods of finger recovery, but I'm uncertain about how to prioritize them for my needs. For instance, there's talk about supplements like creatine and collagen, as well as recovery protocols like ice baths, stretching, massage, and rest times.

The recent collagen research doesn't quite convince me enough to go out and buy a batch, and I know many others feel the same way. To give you some context, I'm currently climbing at a V5 level in bouldering and training on the hangboard 2-3 times a week alongside my climbing sessions.

 Finger recovery is a major concern. I only have the usual prescribed soreness from hangboard, which Hoopers Beta described in their [video ](https://youtu.be/FXyc3DdRnns?si=5MB89DHQNGeGWBTw) a normal, and I don't have any finger injuries. 

What surprises me is that I've seen relatively limited discussion about creatine for recovery in climbing. I haven't tried supplementing it yet, and I'd love to hear your subjective or objective opinions on different supplements and protocols to help me decide what to try!

Thanks!",bouldering

Lately, (and as I have struggled with my health) bouldering has been more about connecting to people and nature and while the existence of this resetting phenomenon is frightening for the longevity of the world, it's refreshing to go out into a space with pads and no expectations to climb routes without the need or utility of naming and grading. Once you forget about goals, and grades, and even sends the focus changes to each other and the landscape. 

Climbing is an act of joy.

169,1696923889.0,Are these goals too much of an oxymoron?,"I've been planning a trip to Paris this coming Summer in order to watch the Olympics and climb hard in gyms and outdoors (likely Font). I want to be in the best climbing shape I can. I have also recently begun taking weightlifting seriously with a power-building sort of approach. Ultimately, my goal with weightlifting is to fill out my frame and gain muscle (bodybuilding), but I still incorporate some strength-based aspects into my workouts. I want to bulk up a bit and look better than I ever have. Are these two goals simply incompatible? Can I effectively embark on both of these endeavors at once? I understand that these two clash, specifically in the sense that, in order to maximize muscle gain, I will need to ""bulk"" by eating at a caloric surplus. Granted, I don't plan on dirty bulking. Instead, I plan on keeping it to more of a ""lean bulk"" and only eating at a mild caloric surplus that is high in protein. This is still, however, non-optimal for climbing, as any added weight that won't help me get up the wall is essentially a waste. Another issue is the idea of recovery. I need to create a schedule that would allow me to lift weights at least 3 times per week on a PPL split and train (for climbing) and climb every week without compromising my gains in either discipline. I think this may be the most challenging part. Should I try and find a way to balance both at once or should I take a one-at-a-time approach where I focus heavily on weightlifting while I bulk for a few months, and begin to focus more on climbing as I cut before the summer?

181,1696900972.0,Where to stand on a volume,"I asked around, I didn't get a proper answer, and I wanted to share my opinion.

Sometimes the (indoors) climb involves a volume with a large, planar facet. Where do you put your feet, close to the wall or close to the edge (or maybe in the center)?

If it's a slab, then usually the wall doesn't have hand holds (positive gradient, need to lean into it) and the volume isn't too slanted. In this case, you want to promote balancing, and you stand on the edge so you'll have more room and a better angle when leaning.

If it's not a slab, then usually there are hand holds, and the volume is sharply slanted and slippery. In this case, you'd like to maximize traction to avoid slipping. The friction force depends on the force in the direction of the normal to the surface (times some factor mu). For simplicity, consider straight legs, where the force direction that you exert is the vector from your hips to your feet. In the local frame of the surface (where the normal is the z-axis), to maximize the component of the force in the normal direction, you want to minimize the angle between your force vector and the normal (dot product projection), i.e. make them as parallel as possible. Thus, you need to stand close to the wall.",bouldering

Near my house there is a big, isolated rock in a forest. Along the two faces there is probably space for around 15-20 boulders if it was all climbable rock. It is used mostly (let's say exclusively) by me and a couple of friends to train, and it isn't and will not become a significant climbing spot, because there isn't enough to climb to make it worth the trip for anyone. 

We set about 6 or 7 good boulders but a lot of the rock is really easy to climb and not interesting at all, and some of it is bad unstable rock.
In this case would some chipping just to make the climbing harder, and not easyer be ok? What about gluing some loose holds? The way it is now the spot is not really good, and I feel like chipping would make it more fun and not take anything away from future climbers. Also, a lot less trips to the climbing gym means more eco friendly climbing, as i have to drive 50 minutes to do bouldering elsewhere.

In February, I was bouldering at the climbing studio and made a not-so-wise decision to jump from a height of around 2 meters. When I landed, I felt a sharp pain in my back, ribs, and possibly other organs (I'm not entirely sure). It seemed like I couldn't breathe properly for about a minute, so I took a short walk. Later, I even managed to complete an easier climb.

Skipping ahead to the next day, I experienced pain in my lower back. It was quite severe, making it difficult to walk or lie down comfortably. I chose not to take any painkillers and instead tried to keep the affected area warm. After about a week, things improved, and I began doing leg raises on a pull-up bar, squats, and stretches, eventually becoming pain-free.

In late March, I moved to the seaside and went for a run on the beach. During the second run, I started feeling some pain again. Once more, I stopped all physical activities and rested. When I returned home in May, I resumed my lower back strengthening routine, and the pain subsided significantly.

Now, in October, after a month of traveling, I've returned home, and unfortunately, I'm dealing with persistent lower back pain. It's not excruciating, but it's definitely bothering me.

I've started doing hip bridges, squats, and these exercises to strengthen it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmGArQBtFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmGArQBtFI)

My plan is this: to keep on doing it for a month, to see if it's getting better, and if not, finally see a physiotherapist.

Have you ever been in a similar situation? Any exercises to help fix/strengthen my lower back?

Thank you!  


  
UPDATE: It turns out my spine does not have the accentuated curves it needs to have, so it handled the fall the way it did. I need to work on decompression, plus balance out my left and right sides, and build some strength in my leg muscles (I did not think they were thiiis weak), and stretch the muscles on my back, plus do some exercises for flexibility/mobility.

What to I want to know is

A) what board system is the “easiest” for beginner climbers to use?

B) is it safe for under 16s to use a moonboard or kilter system?  Obviously it’s a killer on the tendons.

236,1696645596.0,Request: drills for improving accuracy of my “throws”,"Hey everybody,

I’ve been feeling recently that the accuracy of my throws could really use some improvement, and am curious if anyone has some ways of working on it. 

When I say “throw”, I mean those moderately dynamic movements where you’re using the momentum of your body to propel/bump towards a hold. It comes into play a lot during moonboard sessions. I’ll throw for a hold, and essentially just miss it. Sometimes I’ll hit it with a couple fingers, sometimes I’ll miss the entire hold.

I’ve always been a fairly coordinated person (HS basketball, baseball, snowboard, skateboard, surf, some tennis etc), but these moves make me feel super uncoordinated.

I watch moonboard or tension board sessions and guys seem to hit and latch onto holds accurately and first try. How do I get better at these moves other than just more board climbing… which I will also be doing.

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I’d love to hear.

242,1696591623.0,How long do you take to recover ?,"Hello ! 

I fell in love with indoor bouldering back in 2021, so much that it made me get in the best shape of my life just so I could climb easier ! For like 4 month I was going 1.5 times/week on average because I was studying the rest of the time. 

Then I had a big depression and for the rest of the year until august 2022 I got in the WORST shape of my life. Lost all my muscles and gained a good 20kg of only fat. It got so bad just walking 5 min was a pain, I was just overweight not obese, but the big difference in lean and fat tissue + the lack of activity had that much of an impact. 

Now I'm on vacation in my parents town  next to the bouldering gym I started in when studying. I want to go 3 times/week but I physically can't... I let 48 hours between each time, I warm up for a good 10 min and stretch for 10 min after too. I also don't actively climb for a long time just slightly more than a hour, I stay in the gym for a total of 1h30-1h40 but even with this I feel like my arms are destroyed the second time every week. I'm roughly in the same shape that I was before starting the first time just older ( 29 now ). 

Should I wait 72 hours between each seance/ go only twice a week ? How long do you guys go and how often ? It's very frustrating because I want to progress and I do but it's slowed by my own body limitation !",bouldering

245,1696640085.0,Progressive decrease in performance,"Hey y’all. I was wondering if anyone has some insight into what’s been going on with me. For context, I’m a 23 yo AFAB person. I’ve been climbing for 12 years (former team kid).

Here’s a recap of my last year-ish of climbing

Summer-January: I had slow but progressive growth. I became consistent on V7, and I started to flash V6.

January-March: I broke my wrist in January and was out until March

March-June: Once my wrist recovered, I had a huge period of growth. I started to put down V8s, and I could send V7 in 2-4 attempts. I was climbing 3-4 days per week and felt great.

July: I felt a small decrease in my climbing abilities. I went from putting down 7s in a few sessions to continuing to struggle after a few weeks. I thought it was just a series of high gravity days due to job stress, but nbd.

August: I continued to have high gravity days. It became apparent that I wasn’t making any progress of any sort on my projects. It was like I’d hit a wall. I reduced to 2 days per week and added weights back into my rotation (2 days per week).

September to present: I have noticed a decrease in performance. I am struggling to resend things that I flashed a few months ago. I’m tired by the end of my warm up. I took a week off, but that made it worse.

I haven’t had any injuries or (physical) health issues come up. I don’t make a habit of weighing myself due to some previous issues, but last I checked, I’m actually a few pounds less than I was in spring. There haven’t been any significant changes in setting style or crew. Any one able to solve this mystery? Nothing hurts. I just feel kinda crappy and can’t try as hard as I used to be able to 4 months ago.

TLDR: I made a lot of improvement last year. Started in July, I’ve had a slow but steady decline in my climbing abilities. There have been no obvious physical reasons for this. Thoughts?

I’m happy to give more information if needed. Lmk if I need to delete this and move it to a different sub.",bouldering

251,1696607909.0,P3 tensioning male vs female shoes,"I am on the market for new climbing shoes (sport and bouldering mostly, no multi-pitch) and at REI I discovered that the female version of my current shoes (Miura VS) fits me so so so so so so so much better than the male version and I could even downsize more without significant pain. The heel cup of male la sportiva shoes always felt a little too deep but the female one is just so good (side note for all my fellow weird narrow feet people out there).

Question is... Is the P3 tensioning different between male and female / the midsole stiffness is different? Asking because I can actually bend the female version of the Miura VS when wearing them (as I almost fully flatten the shoes just by bending my toes upwards) while it is not possible with new Miura VS male. I am not talking of standing on the shoes, literally just putting them on and flexing my feet.

This route isn’t particularly difficult. It requires a bit of strength and the ability to do a passable heel hook helps but all in all it’s pretty soft.
 
But boy oh boy is it ever satisfying! It’s movement for the sake of movement and just flows nicely. The laddering of bumping your hands up, rolling your foot from the heel hook to a stable stand. It’s all so… comfortable.

Now I wanted to try the Tenaya Mastia and climbers recommend here up to 6 numbers smaller and I do not know how these numbers come about overhand.

318,1696347512.0,London bouldering gyms recommendations,"Hi everyone, a few months ago I went to a bouldering gym in Singapore called bff climb and I loved it. The reasons I did were it was nice and roomy, the beginner route selection was huge and with very fine grained progression and maybe most importantly there were benches! Now benches are great because they let you sit and rest safely between attempts and chat to your friends while appreciating other climbers. 

Inspired by that experience I went bouldering with some friends to vauxwest and it was a total letdown. It felt cramped, easier routes were few in numbers and I felt like I could do easily all the routes of a certain colour but virtually none of the next. And lastly no benches, just the same mats everywhere where it's not as comfortable to sit and you are always quite close to people climbing all around you. 
I was wondering if anyone can recommend any bouldering gyms in London that are closer in nature to the first gym I described and ideally have some benches. 
Attaching a photo so it's clearer what I mean, this isn't the gym I went to but it's the same idea with seating of the mats:

326,1696294770.0,TIL that I'm probably crimping wrong sometimes- my top knuckles are bent forward. How bad is this?,"35M  5 months in.  Intermediate grades up to V6.

I guess I just never was shown the correct way to grip.  Obviously it's hard to screw up slopers, but on small crimps, I've gotten into a habit of curling the tips of my fingers down into the holds.  My fingers naturally like to curl a lot at the top joint when gripping.

I googled around for awhile, but I couldn't find any pics of this, so I am assuming this is possibly bad/very bad form.

I have noticed that as problems have gotten harder, I've done more ""correct"" crimps bending only at the middle knuckle, but that never feels quite as strong unless it's a deep edge.

Anyway, how bad is this?  


Update:  So I guess I'm not the only one who does/has done this.  I am going to reach out to some PT's with a short questionnaire, and see what they think about the biomechanics of it.  If I can get some responses, I'll make an updated post later this week.",bouldering

I went to my local centre a week ago and I haven't stopped thinking about it since. I only got into exercise as an activity last year and had mostly stuck to lifting weights and swimming. I've lost a lot of weight but wanted to advance my strength in a practical way. Climbing activated some ancient monkey neuron in my brain and I can't wait to go back. 

The only issue was the shoes! I am a size UK7, and my feet are wide. I couldn't stomach the rental 7s, or the 8s, and eventually settled on size 9s! 

In a way, it was comparable to when I used to do ballet as a teen and had to wear wooden pointe shoes. I can only compare it to having my feet stuffed into a sweaty satin cinderblock (Yes, I was a terrible ballet dancer and disliked it very much). 

I have autism and sensory issues, so maybe that's what made me freak when the shoes were so tight. How did you get used to it, or was I truly just wearing a shoe that was bad for my feet? If I choose to buy some, are there brands that any of my fellow wide feet ppl can recommend?",bouldering

I have this problem where I sweat so much that I slowly am going through the shoe.  (this is just a theory not sure if it is the actual reason) At the end of my sessions now I have parts of shoe on my toe nails. I have felt the tip of my shoe and if I press with a bit of force I can probably puncture the shoe it is just very thin. I have had these shoes for about 7-8 months.

I wonder if it is just my sweaty feet that cause my shoes to break fast or if it is something else or that it is just the natural amount of time until the shoe is done?",bouldering

408,1695925359.0,The Responsibility of Setters?,"Hoping to get some community input on the discussion some friends and I have been having lately.

Over the last few weeks at the climbing gym there have been a number of accidents, mostly beginner climbers falling off the wall and getting pretty seriously hurt (broken bones in a couple of cases). The falls have been mostly from high up on the wall, usually on ‘sketchy finish moves’.

Personally, I’m a very cautious climber. I climb as static as I can and have bailed many times on finish moves that I just don’t feel comfortable doing. Still, there is a consensus among many of my friends (across a V2-V10 ability range) that the setters seem to love putting up ‘sketchy finish moves’, be it high heel hooks, generally bad feet, committing lurches, among other anxiety-inducing moves.

Difficult movement, stress, and risk go hand in hand with climbing, and especially bouldering. When you climb, even indoors, you are opening yourself up to injury, it’s something that should be understood by every climber. Yet, at the same time, one could argue that setters should do what is possible to mitigate risk if it is in their control, particularly for the large group of new climbers who are just learning the sport. When multiple injuries happen in a short span of time, is it time for the setters to reflect on their setting practices? Or is it simply up to the individual to assess the risk they are in?

Edit: Just want to add to this that I really like the setting team, I’m by no means trying to paint them in a negative light. They set a lot of great and interesting climbs consistently. Although there have been some accidents in a concentrated time frame, it is not typical for them to occur at this frequency. Recent events simply motivated this topic of discussion in a general sense, and reframed the feeling of ‘sketchy finishes’ at the gym",bouldering

425,1695846401.0,I tried to use the Tension Board and now I’m a misogynist.(AMITAH),"If you haven’t used the Tension Board one important thing to know is they made it very easy to share the leds on the holds. It has a auto-disconnect feature which disconnects from your phone after like 20 seconds so after you climb the other person can put their route up.

With that in mind we begin the story. I arrive at the gym with bad skin so I was planning on climbing on wood holds which is great for skin. I do some hangboard warm up stuff etc. Then I walk to the tension board to climb. I see someone is there and mind you I would ALWAYS ask someone to climb the tension board. However I open with an icebreaker question to the female at the board: “hey what’s the angle at?” She barely took out her AirPods and said in a very cold and somewhat disgusted tone: “I don’t know, 40” and threw her pods right back in. After this I’m made very uncomfortable by her response and I don’t really want to ask her anything else.

However I don’t believe that she has the exclusive right to just climb the board completely alone. It’s an expensive piece of machinery and should be reasonably shared by anyone who’s in the gym. But to not be obstructive I don’t use the leds which again are super easy to share. I take the time to learn the route I want to do on my phone and I of course wait for her to finish brushing and climbing her routes of course. Unbeknownst to me this was making her very upset because apparently the tension board only belongs to her. It goes like this for a decent amount of time, maybe 20 minutes or so? Finally I have trouble with a route because of the lack of leds. So for this go after she tries hers i connect to the LEDs and I complete the route. She is able to instantly connect back without any inconvenience and does so as soon as I land. This is fine, I let her climb a lot more than I do and I still take the time to familiarize myself with the next route without the lights. I then wait my rightful turn and turn the LEDs on to try where she then says something a long the lines of: “I’m trying to climb here and you’re being very rude”

Finally she fucking said something instead of passive aggressive grunts and aggressive brushing. I argue with this saying she was unkind to me when I first got there. I accuse her being selfish and thinking her training is important to me etc etc. Not very productive conversation. She eventually closes it with that’s why men make women feel uncomfortable at the gym. If there’s any other details you need let me know. AMITAH???!!!

Edit: A lot of people are freaking out about my use of “female” I’m sorry i didn’t know that was an alpha male word now. In conversation I use woman if that makes me less evil in your eyes.

Anotha one: there are some that have actually literally thought I now hate women because of an interaction. NO lmao",bouldering

428,1695869045.0,How long does it usually take a beginner to really see improvement?,"I’m a new climber and I’ve just recently started going to a bouldering gym a couple weeks ago. For context, I’m probably below average in physical strength for my size (5’10, 150 lbs) having not really exercised in the last 5 years, so I don’t expect to see any immediate gains or anything. Right now I can do all v0’s in my gym and majority of the v1’s but I’m quickly realizing both my grip strength and arm strength in general will be an issue in the near future, even just for the harder v1’s. I’ve tried several of the v2’s but don’t seem to even have the strength to start them. 

I was wondering ballpark estimate, around how long would it likely take for me to build up the strength to start doing the v2’s? I’ve been going 3 times a weeks with 90 minute sessions and while I feel like I’m slowly starting to get the hang of v1’s, v2’s still seem so far away, my arms give out within the first couple holds if I can even get started. 

And seeing as how arm and core strength is a big issue for me right now, should I be doing some muscle training as well? Right now I’ve mostly been using just 20 lb dumbbells and resistance bands for some light training after climbing (my climbing gym is in a small town that doesn’t have much in the way of regular gym equipment outside the actual bouldering walls). 

I’d appreciate any answers or advice, I’ve really been enjoying it so far and it’s been a good motivator to get myself moving for someone like me who hasn’t exercised in years.

434,1695874599.0,Wrist pain for 1.5 years after bouldering,"January 2022 I was climbing around 3x a week, mostly bouldering. I first noticed the pain when I was working on a problem with a sloper. It wasn’t sharp, and I didn’t have a moment specifically where I was like “oh I just hurt myself” so I ignored the pain and carried on for a bit. This gradually got worse and now seems to be chronic. 

I have serious pain during wrist flexion and dorsiflexion, only when weight bearing. I can’t do a push up on my palms, can’t hold a plank, bicep curls hurt a lot, and pull ups are uncomfortable.  

The x-ray came back normal and the MRI revealed a dorsal ganglion cyst 2.4 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm (the ultrasound showed it’s quite deep) and a partial tear of the membrane of the scapholunate ligament (basically in the middle of the hand). TFCC and extensor and flexor tendons intact. 

I’ve tried icing, resting, bracing (at night and during the day), wrist widget, and PT. I’ve had cortisone/lidocaine shots in the cyst twice, and once in my TFCC. My doctor is reluctant to remove the cyst because 1. It is likely to come back and 2. It is quite deep and could be painful (maybe dangerous bc of nerves?). He is at a loss because the pain really presents in the TFCC/outer edge of hand and wrist, and the part of my forearm closest to my hand (which isn’t usual for a ganglion cyst issue). 

I guess the answer is go see another doctor, but I’m exhausted over this atm. I’m wondering if anyone has a similar experience of wrist pain that just doesn’t go away? Sadly this has been preventing me from climbing for about a year. I think I’ll go straight to a different physical therapist next cause I’m tired of a $20 copay just to get a shot that does nothing or be told to rest and take ibuprofen.",bouldering

456,1695746648.0,Sensitive Question: I've had a hard time getting bigger people into climbing.,"Hello!

I am an avid climber, and I love to introduce new people to the sport. My advice is always, ""Don't compare yourself to other people, this sport is about winning against yourself"".

I've found that people that weigh more get discouraged from climbing because it's a lot harder for them compared to me who's a slimmer guy - or most people at the gym because climbers tend to be slimmer.

Any advice here? Or any of you have similar experiences? How can we motivate better because I really do think this is a sport for everyone able-bodied!

EDIT: Consolidated points from the comments:
- Be as welcoming and supportive as possible. Showing and following examples of larger climbers on social media can help.
- Consider top rope to bouldering!
- Consider slab climbing! Will lessen the impacts of weight.
- Good low level setting is really important to get new people into the sport!
- Heavier individuals tend to experience more finger strain. And falls are more dangerous.
- Climbing is not for everyone. We just need to do our best to encourage anyone interested.",bouldering

It's especially useful when you've burned through all the boulders that are set, and can be pretty hilarious when moving from a v2 to a v3 requires an insane traverse because the set doesn't have a convenient option.",bouldering

I've been going at this for a good minute now and I just can't work out the body positioning to grab the next hold.

Small crimp, nice little pocket but, it's hard to catch.

No holds around the barette and the third circle is absolutely horrific. It's definitely a tension move I feel, you can't pull on it.

The foot next to the lowest circle is worthless. I can't figure out how to use it on my current max position without pushing myself off the wall.

489,1695733149.0,Large crash pad recommendations for long approaches,"Hey all. I'm looking for a recommendation for a large crash pad for long walk ins.

I often boulder alone and more often than not the crag requires a long walk in (40-60 mins). For now I'm mostly using a small Black Diamond circuit pad + blubber, which is nice to carry and enough protection for easier problems, but just not suitable for hard projecting.

I'm looking to get a single big cushy pad that can help give me the confidence to try hard and which would be feasible to carry on a long approach. I enjoy a good slog up a hill, so I dont think I'll mind the weight as much as the comfort of the carrying system. From my research, it seems like the Petzl Cirro and Moon Saturn would be good options. I can get either for basically the same price. I'm particularly impressed by the Petzl carrying system, but it's a bit heavier and a bit smaller than the Moon. I've looked at Organic but the big ones are a bit too spendy for me.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations.

Edit: I ended up going with the Flashed Big Squishy since I needed to store it folded. The carrying system is great: it feels lighter than my old mid size Grizel pad with cheap straps even though it's almost twice the weight.

491,1695645983.0,Strength depleted after 30-45mins.,"A little background,  
I'm a casual climber. Probably clocks in 1-2 sessions per week. Been climbing for about 1.5 years so not too long.  


My energy/ strength almost gets depleted after about 30-45 mins of climbing (excluding warm up).  
Ive been noticing it for quite some time.  
I would go to a gym.  
do my warm up (about 15 mins)  
do some easy climbs (about 15 mins)  
And then start to do the ones that is right around my grade ceiling.  
I would easily send the first few.  
After around 30-45 mins, I find myself having almost no strength to even do the start or like the first few move.  Sometimes my fingers just refuse to cooperate, while other time, i can pull as hard as i can with everything i have and barely make the next move.  
I used to think maybe those are the harder ones in that grade range.   
However, I would come back the next time and once again easily send them when I'm fresh.  


I dont really check how long I rest. I will just go when ive felt rested enough if that makes sense.  


Question is, is this normal? And if it is, how is it possible that I see people climb like 4-5 hours straight without having issues. if it isnt normal, then is there any advice as to how I could improve on this.  
Perhaps some endurance training of sorts.  
I've never really trained much on finger boards and/or endurance walls or any other sort of strength/ functional training.

My aim is to keep my street clothes chalk free, with that in mind how can I wash the chalk off my hands before touching my street clothes and without going barefoot or wearing my climbing shoes into the toilet other than having a sink outside the toilets? I sense the pushback is coming from people that have never experienced the luxury of a hand washing station outside the toilets because the comments from people whose gyms do have them seem to be grateful for them and are saying how useful they are. I really didn't expect this to be so controversial but it's quite funny how passionate some of you are about other people washing their hands.

It might not be the chalk, but I have been wanting to get my own bag anyway, so- are there any favorite brands that don’t dry out skin as much? 

I did Google it & read that liquid chalk is more likely to dry them due to alcohol, but I’m curious as to whether any dry brands have come up with a better formula to retain moisture.  I searched the subreddit history and didn’t see a question specific to moisture. 

Thanks in advance - this subreddit has been so great for a beginner to learn from.

Edit: I know chalk is meant to dry the skin, but until recently I didn’t know liquid chalk even existed.  I’ve been told frequently that the chalk the gym uses is inferior to other chalks.

I’ll stop for a couple minutes sometimes to relax my muscles and watch other climbers but sometimes I just go straight to the next problem or attempt. I climbed two days in a row at one point and the next night, both my hands were red and swollen. This week, I climbed a couple hours on Monday and regretfully decided to take off the rest of the week because I am going for a long bike ride over the weekend and don’t want my hands and wrists to be in pain for hours pressed against the handlebars.

1) Am I doing something wrong, or is it maybe just my hand strength needs to catch up with the rest of my skill set? Is this just my life now or will this issue resolve itself as I keep climbing?
2) What can I do if anything to avoid so much soreness? (In terms of technique, hand stretches, maybe resting more between climbs, etc). Is it better to take more rest days or just push through?

On the contrary if I see a gym with bare wood walls, it instantly looks much nicer.

619,1695234427.0,Instinct VS Men's vs Women's (Grip2 vs Edge),"Hey there. For some background I recently purchased Instinct VS Women's (VSW) in a size 40 and enjoy them but wanted something a little stiffer. So I purchased the VS Men's (VSM) in a 39.5 to hopefully have a stiffer shoe (since it uses XS Edge rubber versus the Grip2 of the VSW) and the sizing is too small. A 40 in the VSM is too baggy whereas the 40 in VSW is nearly perfect right out of the box.    
    
My issue is that I already have Women's Skwamas and wanted something stiffer. The VSW feels just slightly stiffer than the Skwamas whereas the VSM is definitely a bit stiffer. Like a pair of Solutions. I'm debating on whether I should use a bad fitting VSM or just resole the VSW down the road with some XS Edge? I would consider the Skwama as my ""try hard"" shoe so don't necessarily need a performance fit for the VSM. Would the VSM stretch a half size or so even if it's synthetic? I don't mind suffering a bit.     
    
Is there maybe another shoe I should consider? The fit on the Skwamas is nearly perfect except the toe box is barely too small. The VSW fits almost perfect as well with just a little burping in the heel. Anything similar to those with the feel/stiffness I'm looking for? Thanks in advance!",bouldering

622,1695163651.0,Time to start hangboarding?,"I've been climbing for about a year now. I can flash most V3's, and I can get up most V4's after projecting for a little while. I still struggle with what I call ""armbuster"" V4's that are long, crimpy and overhanging. V5's seem like a complete other level of climbing. In my experience, good beta can get me up a lot of V4's, but anything beyond that requires a higher level of physical ability in terms of grip strength, flexibility, and endurance. Suffice to say that I've hit a plateau.

I'm not super pushing myself to my limits here, just enough that it starts to pump the forearms a bit by the time we're getting to the next stop.

624,1695134994.0,Etiquette around hanging and swinging from holds,"Hi,

TLDR: I'm new to bouldering, and wonder if it's bad etiquette to hang or swing from a single hold, because this can damage the hold or wall. Is that a fair concern?

Some context: I'm new to bouldering, but have decent upper body strength from other sports and weightlifting. I realised I can do quite a few medium difficulty climbs just by being an idiot gymbro and hauling myself up with my arms, especially on overhangs where my legs just dangle. I know this isn't the best way to learn and definitely not what the designer intended, but it's fun and sometimes just means I get used to a climb before doing it in a more technical way.

I'm a bit worried that I'm putting too much weight on the holds, especially where I'm using a bit of momentum. Am I potentially damaging them, or are they tough enough to deal with this?

I'm not concerned about safety (nobody is ever below me), just if this is considered disrespectful or damaging. I sometimes feel like a bit like an stupid gorilla surrounded by delicate and precise mountain goats. In case it makes a difference I'm probably an average weight guy.",bouldering
625,1695147793.0,How much pain should I tolerate?,"Hi all, 
I've recently purchased my first pair of climbing shoes for indoors climbing, the Scarpa Veloce for women. I got them half a size bigger than what I normally wear as they felt the best while trying them on in the store compared to other models like it. However, there is some pressure on my big toe that became almost unbearable near the end of my (2h) climbing session to test them out. It creates a dent and a light blue-ish mark near the joint closest to the tip of my toe.

My question is whether this might be dangerous and/or whether this could be fixed with some tape. It's difficult to find out which level of pain is 'normal' and not harmful, especially since I can definitely bite through the pain for a whole climbing session. My main worry is that I would harm myself by misinterpreting what people mean with normal amounts of pain or discomfort while breaking the shoes in, while thinking that it's okay because they will still stretch out.

628,1695168671.0,Hangboarding for beginners: An Anecdotal account,"Hey there beanie people, I've seen a lot of you strongly advise beginners to stay away from hangboards for the first year of their climbing. And to be fair, you have a point, but I think there is a way in which beginners can still benefit from using hangboards.

**Context:** I started climbing 4 months ago after about 5 years of on-and-off weight lifting, and while I had no real issues with general body strength, my finger strength was abysmal. I couldn't even hold the biggest crimps, even shallow jugs were a real challenge to hold onto.

So, I decided to give the hangboard a try, to compensate for this weakness. And of course, I hurt my fingers. Nothing dramatic, but definitely sprained 3 pulleys.

I took a break away from climbing for 2 weeks to heal and stayed away from hangboards after that because maybe y'all did indeed have a point about these things being dangerous if used incorrectly. After all my fingers would eventually get stronger just by climbing.

**Experiment:** Fast forward a few months and my fingers were still really holding me back. I did some research and found [this program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBTI9qiH4UE&pp=ygUcaGFuZ2JvYXJkaW5nIHR3byB0aW1lcyBhIGRheQ%3D%3D) from Emil Abrahamsson's brother about doing no-hangs 2 times a day for 10 minutes (rests included).

For those of you who don't know, this exercise consists of hanging from a hangboard without taking your feet off the ground, this allows you to control how much weight you actually put on your fingers, and to relieve the load progressively as well.

So, very carefully, I decided to give it a try. I do not have a hangboard at home yet, so I decided to do these at the end of my warm-up, right before hopping on the wall (I climb 3 times a week):

\- 10s no hang on the jugs of the beastmaker 1000 (trying to undergrip as much as possible)- 50s rest

\- 10s no hang on the 40mm edge- 50s rest

\- 10s no hang on the 15mm edge- 50s rest

\- 10s no hang on the 15mm edge with a 3 finger drag- 50s rest

**Result:** I did this for a bit more than a month now, and the result is pretty incredible. I can climb on crimps now. It feels really weird because my brain still hasn't adjusted to the fact that I can now use these tiny holds. So I'll look at a new problem, think ""no way I can hold that"", get bullied by my friends to give it a try, and lo and behold, I can climb it.

I also feel that my fingers feel a lot better, on or off the wall.

There probably is a part of confirmation bias in there, since with all that climbing my fingers were bound to get stronger, but I can't help but think that this routine has been instrumental in strengthening my fingers in a safe way.

**Conclusion:** As I mentioned in the title, this is anecdotal, it's only my experience, ~~but if you struggle with finger strength, even as a beginner, I would suggest you give it a try. Carefully though, take the time to load your fingers slowly, and relieve them as soon as you feel strain or discomfort.~~

Edit: A few of you helpfully made me realize that despite the positive effect hangbording has had on my climbing, it would be irresponsible of me to recommend it as is. All I can do is expose my experience, and suggest that you do your research on what could be helpful for you. You'll find helpful references in the comments.",bouldering

631,1695153273.0,"Total beginner, have a few questions regarding shoes, fear of falling, and progression","My cousin who is a climber visited from the States recently with his girlfriend who is also a climber and they took my boyfriend and I climbing. I loved it and have been dying to go again since. I went again this evening and still loved it. I really want to keep it up, I don't think I see myself competing or climbing actual natural boulders but I'd love to improve and be able to do some of the more difficult routes in time.

I have some questions...

1. The shoes to me are a bit of a mystery so far. I know they're not supposed to be 'comfortable' and likewise they're not supposed to be 'excruciating'. On my first day I told the guy I was a size 4 (thats a 6 US) and he told me I'd probably be a 3 but to try the 4 and see how it feels. It was excruciating. My toes were numb and throbbing within 10 minutes and most of those 10 minutes I was just standing watching others climb. I grabbed the size 5 next (US 7), he was still telling me he thought I was more like a 3 but I couldn't fathom wearing a 3 if the 4 made my toes numb. 5 was a lot better but I still get a really sore big toe on my left foot. That foot must be bigger than the other but it makes me want to cut my toe off because its the only pain point 🤣 the 5 are definitely too big because I have narrow feet but yet the 4 was excruciating. So I guess my question is, if I were to buy my own shoes, would I go for a size 4 and hope for the best they become more comfy? Or would a 5 be safer? I definitely want to buy my own shoes.

2. What should the progression look like for a beginner? My first time I tried a mix of V1 and V2 climbs and I did the same this time, V1 and V2 but definitely was better at it this time. The down climbs are my weak spot, I'm pretty good at climbing up the easy routes but when it comes to getting down and sometimes I can't find a good hold, I get nervous and start to shake/get weaker and that makes me more nervous because I don't want to fall, I'd rather down climb. That's another thing- falling, it's something I'm scared of because even though I've seen videos of how to do it, I'm afraid I wouldn't do it right. So yeah, should I wait till I'm an EXPERT at those V1s amd V2s AND downclimbs before trying anything new?

As I have been hitting V5s on the 60° and the caves (vertical and low steepness have not been an issue at all), I've noticed that it seems that there's less emphasis on leg strength and more on arm strength. Although I could be wrong.

Legs are still important, but I find them used more for stability (heel hooks/pulls, flagging, smears), rather than for power, other than pistol squats and dynos.

I know there isn't much I can do really as I am a sweaty person, but if any super wicking brands exist out there it would feel such a relief and would really help me out.

674,1694967195.0,How to avoid getting pumped?,"I've been climbing consistently (3-4 times per week) for 10 months now. But I still have a problem, getting pump. Depending on the climbs I am projecting, sometimes I am pulley pumped withing 30-40 minutes. I'd say average is 45-60 minutes and then I am usually finished my session. It's usually not that big of a deal, I feel my progess is fine even with shorter sessions. But sometimes I want to climb more.

It seems this hasn't reduced since I started nearly a year ago, I take even longer breaks now between attempts than ever because the projects and grades are harder and harder. Climb V3-4 and project v4-5.

I even started doing pull ups at home on a doorway pull-up bar once a week (or at the gym at work once a week)

How do you avoid getting pumped so quickly?

Edit: I do 10 minutes of stretching and mobility and 10 minutes of easy climbing before starting. I'm 30 years old, very little activity prior to climbing",bouldering

I'm now a month in and going three times a week. Today I finally got really comfortable with the last V0 that was challenging me and started on some V1s to try and find the next thing I wanted to tackle. But every single one I started ended up with my one of my toes slipping off the hold.

I'm not sure if it's the footholds being smaller, or that I'm using pretty stiff toed rental shoes, or just that my technique is obviously not there yet. I'm also a lot heavier than most of y'all I'm sure, at 6' and 270lbs. 

I'm assuming that just like most things, it's less about the tool and more about how you use it. But figured I'd ask some people who know more than me anyway ;)

I am in the process of recovery and gaining back my full arm movement hopefully. But my question is,
Are there people with this kind of implant that are still bouldering? And if yes what are your experiences?

While holding on with my right hand I felt my right shoulder getting locked. I was still barely holding on with my left hand so for a few seconds I tried my hardest not to fall until my shoulder started hurting, so I let myself fall.

For the next 15 minutes my shoulder felt really painful but then it went away. I tried to do one of the easiest problems in the gym but while climbing my shoulder started hurting again, so I left the gym straight after.
That evening I wasn't really feeling much anymore but the next day the pain was much worse. 
I feel like the pain has slowly getting better. In normal relaxed position I actually don't feel much from my shoulder but in certain positions I get this sharp jab of pain. Also when I just wake up it's not feeling that great.

695,1694893503.0,Anyone else struggle with frustration?,"Looking for advice dealing with frustration while bouldering. I'm generally a calm person who is not quick to anger, especially not easy to offend. I'm usually fine with being not-so-great at stuff, including physical activities. I'm a naturally terrible runner, for example, but I've mostly enoyed running everyday for years and that's never bothered me. Over time I got better, but I'm still pretty slow for how often I run, but I've always just enjoyed the process. I'm not too bad at lifting weights naturally, but as a beginner I was still quite weak and that didn't bother me at all either. However things are different at the wall.   

In the beginning I was patient and loved every sesson. Lately though I find myself  having fun in the beginning of the session but leaving the gym fuming every time. It really bothers me that the majority of people at the gym are better than me at climbing. I consider myself in good shape and I'm a smaller wiry guy who looks like he should be able to be a halfway decent climber. I weigh 145 lbs. I can do 20 pullups. I can deadlift 400 lb and I can bench press 225 lbs. I can run a 5k in under 20 minutes. I feel like I am strong for my size and relatively athletic.   

But I can't do most of the v2-v4 problems at my gym, and even fail on some v1-v2 problems. Knowing that indoor climbing is inflated, these are probably v0-v1 problems I'm failing at. The majority of the gym is able to do them. I feel like a goof and I feel like I'm not getting any better. I end up throwing myself at the wall until my fingers bleed or my bicep locks up and spasms and then I can't climb again for a week. When I left the gym today I called my sister to vent, because she also climbs and I know she dealt with this too. That helped a lot to talk with her.   

One thing I considered is trying to find bouldering lessons. Another thing is switching up to a different gym for a while so there are more easier routes I haven't done to mix things up. I know  there is not really an answer here, but would like to hear if anyone else struggled with these feelings and how they managed to let go of their ego and enjoy the process again.",bouldering

I'm looking for some advice from the climbing Hivemind. I love bouldering, it's the only activity I've ever truly taken to, and I'd love to be able to climb a lot more/harder than I can...

Unfortunately, I screwed my back up several years ago building a patio for my parent's house (ended up with a bulging disc in my lower back) that tends to flare up when I do certain exercises... such as bouldering. This is mostly when I jump off the wall, and I've essentially started downclimbing every route to dodge this particular issue, but I still feel I'm weak in the lower back / always needing to guard the area when climbing. 

I'm just wondering if anyone would have any advice on how to achieve my aim of climbing a few times a week without having to take weeks off at a time to rest my  back? I've previously been told that a weak core might not be helping here, so any tips on strengthening there would be super helpful as well.

I started bouldering 3 months ago and I’m doing it 3 - 4 times a week now. I know I’m growing stronger every week, but I do have one problem that I want to solve. 

I’m having a lot of difficulties climbing the balance type of routes. The ones with the difficult holds with the walls leaning forward (not sure what the right word is, but it’s the opposite of an ‘overhang’). 

I’m really scared to fall off those, one of the reasons being that I tore my ankle falling off the wall the 6th time I went bouldering. I also feel like I don’t know what to do when I try these routes, which is the opposite of how I’m feeling while doing an overhang route. I keep trying these typ of routes (because I hate giving up when it comes to sports), but I barely get any progress. However, I started bouldering to conquer anxiety and low self-esteem (thinking I quit things too easily), so my motivation is pretty high to get it right. 😅

Do you guys have some advice for me? I really wanna get better, especially at those routes that I find difficult and scary. Thanks for reading 🖤",bouldering

Except for my forearms which are often pumped I don't feel a need to stretch.  
Sometimes I'll stretch just because that's what I see people do but the other day I went home without stretching and then I thought ""Oh I didn't stretch at all I wonder if it's bad""

So do people stretch so much because they do harder sessions than I am?  
Or because you need to stretch no matter if you feel like it or not (because not stretching will be bad somehow)?  
Or maybe they just think stretching will benefit you whether you feel like it or not?

I'm very new (like a month) into my bouldering journey. I've been climbing 3 times a week (M/W/Sat or Tu/Thur/Sat) and have been feeling a bit of soreness at the base of my ring fingers and middle fingers. There's a spot that if I rub with my finger (or more obviously with my fingernail) that I can feel a bit of a lump. (Maybe 1mm). It is most prominent in my sorest finger. (Left ring). But if I rub any finger in that spot I can feel a little bit of soreness on any middle or ring finger. Spot is highlighted in picture - and it pretty much is felt only in that spot (doesn't go behind or to sides.

I would classify the pain level as quite low, but one day about a week ago, it did probably hit a 5/10 when grabbing say a medal door handle. Since, the pain feels more like a 1 to 2 depending on how hard i hit it against something or if I put a lot of weight on it. If I run my fingernail across the nodule, it feels kind of firm. I have no loss of mobility, but forcing a crimp-like position does feel a little bit of pain in my ring fingers.

Anyone know what the lump/soreness might be from? Just over use (climbing too often too fast)? Or a bone bruise from grabbing a hold too fast? Or A2 strain? Or is there another tendon/ligament there?


Thank you for any help, I realize finger pain posts are quite common. Just a little confused about this nodule/lumpiness.",bouldering

If this happens and you still want to climb, wrap across your palm or finger with climbing tape, or as seen in this youtube video (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2vL8aofFQS4). 

For the aftercare I recommend removing “the flapper”, try to remove as much dead skin with disinfected scissors or cuticle scissors. Wash your hands, and then disinfect the wound. 

Apply Duoderm, this acts as a second skin and does magic. You will notice your wound seep out liquid which is normal. Thus clear liquid is vital in wound healing. Then to make it stay in place apply any bandage. 

Replace the Duoderm only when it leaks. But do not disinfect your wound. If you constantly clean your wound it will take longer for it to heal, thats if your would appears nice and clean. If its leaking yellow or green discharge, see a gp.

Duoderm might be hard to find, so call your local chemist and pharmacy.

Take care!

Please feel free to add your input! This is just what I have learnt.

Recently, I moved to a different area for a new job. My local gym is very big, it's part of a big chain of climbing gyms, and they always have high quality routes for bouldering and tr/lead, they set mew stuff every week, moonboard, etc. 

But the thing is that people just totally suck. I'd admit I'm not the most extroverted person, but I usually do fine in social situations. But here, it just seems like no one has any interest in being friendly with me. I try to have like brief conversations with people to discuss like a beta or something, but they usually don't go any further than that. I'm one of the strongest climbers there (like definetely not the best, boulder around v7-v9 which is better than most people I see), but almost no one knows my name and I barely get to rope climb outside of the autobelay due to lack of partners. If I reach out to someone for belaying, they end up ghosting me most of the time.

And I've been here for almost 1 year, so obviously lots of regulars recognize me, they just aren't friendly to me.

I barely get to climb outdoors anymore, due to this, which makes me kinda sad.

The only people that tend to be friendly, show up really rarely and tend to be like v0 climbers. 

I love climbing and it's one of my favorite things to do, but I feel like the environment here is just making me lost motivation for climbing. And I just feel frustrated after my climbing sessions.

I try holding tension on every move I attempt as I heard this was good practice on a moonbaord and now I’ve learnt that method I can’t stop doing that even if it’s impossible to do so. I reckon this is why I look down as the second I feel my toe loose tension I give up.

925,1693935415.0,Seeking Travel Tips for Fontainebleau,"Hello!

So I've done a fair bit of research, but thought I'd see if any helpful people could give some personal advice based on my situation and background. I've tried posting in other climbing groups but it doesn't seem to let me..

Situation:

I'm going to Fontainebleau (Bouldering) for a few days in October (1 day on, a few days off, 2 days on) with my girlfriend. Planning to Stay in Paris, and then probably take the train and bus to Font. We were going to find somewhere in Font to rent a few crash pads, and download and subscribe to 27 Crags (since I was told with how huge font is the guidebook isn't always reliable). At Font the plan was just to try everything a few goes, and join any group (after asking) we saw for a bit as we explored.

Background:

We are from Canada and have never been there before but have climbed outdoors on limestone and granite. Looking for boulders anywhere from V0-V7/4-7a+. Just want to have fun and explore. Also to note, we only know very very basic French and will probably memorize a few phrases for the trip.

&#x200B;

So my questions are:

1. Is 27 Crags enough, or should I also get a guidebook (like Secret or Fun Bloc ) or both?
2. Is it highly recommended to drive there with a rental service for car and crash pads (like [https://www.padadise.com/](https://www.padadise.com/)) or a service like [Blablacar](https://www.blablacar.fr/search-car-sharing) or is bussing/biking from the nearest crash pad rental in Fontainebleau town fine?
3. Any recommendations on where to rent crash pads (I saw rental with car as a package, Karma climbing gym, [https://www.climb-fontainebleau.com/location-crash-pad](https://www.climb-fontainebleau.com/location-crash-pad), and [https://www.scape-shop.com/](https://www.scape-shop.com/))?
4. Is there any chat board (I just see Mountain Project and [https://www.facebook.com/groups/FontainebleauClimbingPage/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/FontainebleauClimbingPage/)?) or good way to find fellow climbers to join going to Font when we go or tag along with them? Would make it much easier to join others.
5. Any specific areas you recommend for either beginners to Font style, more accessible (by walk) climbing, or more people who we can join (assuming hopefully they don't mind)? I read  Rocher Canon was best for being in one area, or Bas Cuvier for low balls.
6. Will our skin be able to handle it?
7. Generally speaking, are soft shoes recommended or stiff? Aggressive or more Moderate?
8. Any training advice to prepare for Font?
9. Any more preparation or general tips you recommend?",bouldering

Recently I've come off a long climbing break and started getting back into things again. I've been getting my strength back slowly but surely and that's been great. 

The one problem so far has been projecting. While I'm psyched to try hard on stuff and have finished a good couple of projects, it feels like the magic is gone. Fighting through a boulder at my limit and barely succeeding used to fill me with such a sense of victory and now there's none of that. Just a vague hollow feeling. I don't feel like my sends are earned even after many failed attempts beforehand. I'm not sure what to do about it. I miss that feeling and I still love climbing but that's been damping my mood while on the wall of late.

I’ve downsized two sizes and there’s still a gap. I’ve tried so many different pairs of climbing shoes that I can get my hands on and I’m about to just give up. 🙃


These are the shoes I’ve tried but majority doesn’t fit my heel or width of my foot. The only one that I’ve tried recently that has a better heel is the Vapor S. Decided to buy it and my left side is uncomfortable but manageable but the toe box on the right side is killing my pinky toe (on the second day); pinky toe is pretty much curled down. I just looked up, the toe box fits narrow feet and so I think I’m about to return it unless I can find a way to stretch the width.

Should I get another pair that are more durable? And if so does anyone have any suggestions for a slightly cheaper, durable, and maybe little bit comfier shoe?",bouldering

992,1693602526.0,Improvement is almost inevitable.,"So I noticed something while climbing this evening. I’m getting better.
 
Not just because I’m able to send harder routes but because I accept that I can send harder routes.
 
Over the last few weeks I’ve gone from spending my time climbing the routes I know I can to climbing the routes I think I can.
 
To be fair it’s ending up in a higher failure rate - for now - but I’m feeling better about myself, pushing myself and getting stronger.
 
In short, climbing to the maximum of my abilities is SO MUCH MORE rewarding when I finally send the route. The failures are only failures if I don’t learn from them.
 
…but I still ensure I end on a send 😄",bouldering
