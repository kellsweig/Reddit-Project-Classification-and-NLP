Hardly inline with the speaches and virtue signalling. Maybe they know an election is coming and home heating bills might be on the ballot. Impressively, it's the efficiency they are doing it at (see below). 

>The prior record was 13.1 million barrels a day hit in February 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down the economy. 

>What's perhaps most impressive about the steady surge in oil production is the fact that the weekly US oil rig count remains well below the 2014 peak of more than 1,600 rigs. **There were just 502 active oil rigs in the US last week, representing a 69% decline from the 2014 peak**. That shows just how efficient America's energy industry has become after a period of depressed oil prices from 2014 through 2021. 

>""Unlike in the 1970s, the US is a net exporter of petroleum products. That means that the trade deficit now tends to narrow as petroleum prices rise, supporting the value of the US dollar and reducing prices of imports and related inflation pressures,"" Adams said.

If you don't own a home or don't want or can't afford roof top solar, you pay higher electric bills the wealthier don't endure. If you get $7500 tax credit on an EV truck (in U.S. full-size truck buyers earn $76-$83k, i.e. above median for cheaper gas trucks), you contribute to the budget deficit while clearly able to afford the EV w/o the tax break. 

The authors cite jobs displaced (e.g. oil/coal/auto workers), and encourage fair treatment of the less wealthy....but don't really explain how. One means is de-accelerating NetZero (e.g. U.K.) & perhaps elimination of intermittent energy subsidies while slowing EVs & green powerplants (compromise gas turbines?). 

The general public non-wealthy already drive gas-powered cars/trucks & need lower power bills. Elimination of new gas vehicles will raise used gas-car prices & intermittent energy isn't cheaper as exemplified by E.U. & U.K. power bills & those in coastal U.S. states.",climateskeptics

Ford & others might be smart to emphasize hybrid trucks like they're already doing with their 3.5TTV6 & free hybrid upgrade. If that could be done for under $50 grand, they might find plentiful buyers.

&#x200B;

Here is the problem with science today (speaking as an older chemist with multiple patents).  Advancements in science NEVER come from the middle.  Advancements come from the fringes.  Science today, especially in academia, is all about peer review.  Every PhD is taught this.  So the best scientist have tons of papers that have been peer reviewed.  So the best scientist today are the ones in the very, very middle of group think.  

&#x200B;

Saw a video from an old ecologist in Africa.  He was complaining that none of the PhD's that come to study with him have been in the field or have the ability to observe.  His example was that if you took the best 50 candle makers in the world in the late 1800's and gave them all the money in the world, not one of them would have come up with the light bulb.  If peer review was around at that time, everyone of them would be top of the field for illumining rooms.

88,1696780618.0,IPCC Global Warming Reports Underestimated Role of Sun in Warming: Study,"Collectively, all of these results confirm C2021's conclusion that varying TSI choice can dramatically alter the attribution results. That is, for all three instrumentally based STs (two land-based estimates and one ocean-based estimate), the fitting yields a wide range of conclusions from the long-term warming being ""mostly anthropogenic"" to ""mostly natural""—as C2021 had found. 

This is consistent with three recent analyses that built upon the findings of C2021 and confirmed that much of the warming since the late 19th century can be explained in terms of changing solar activity (Stefani 2021; Harde 2022; Scafetta 2023).

Given this, we suggest that the unabashed assertions of RB2022 offer a cautionary tale to researchers against engaging in unwarranted hubris.

https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/acf18e

The result suggests that at least about 80% of the solar influence on the climate may not be induced by TSI forcing alone, but rather by other Sun-climate processes (e.g., by a solar magnetic modulation of cosmic ray and other particle fluxes, and/or others), which must be thoroughly investigated and physically understood before trustworthy GCMs can be created. 

This result explains why empirical studies often found that the solar contribution to climate changes throughout the Holocene has been significant, whereas GCM-based studies, which only adopt radiative forcings, suggest that the Sun plays a relatively modest role.

Independent journalist Ron Kendall Jr warns of “turbine graveyards” which have been popping up over the US state of Texas as turbine blades reach their useable life.   Texas is home to more than 15,000 wind turbines and has been dubbed a “clean energy powerhouse”.    In a documentary produced by Yucca Films, Mr Kendall Jr investigates the lifespan of the turbines and where they go once used.   “Once they reach their usable life we are seeing more of these, I like to call them turbine graveyards, popping up throughout the state, some to the scale of over [20 to 40 acres of maybe ten tall stacked up](https://youtu.be/Tj_ugf1j0wk?t=164),” he told Sky News host James Morrow.  “**It doesn’t seem like there was much thought into the end of life for a lot of these renewable energy sources.**”   Mr Kendall Jr added many blades are being replaced within two years on some of the newer facilities.",climateskeptics

In the Vostok Ice core data, we see CO2 and temperature moving together (I won't talk about the 800 year delay here). It has been theorized CO2 goes up, temperature goes up. CO2 goes down, temperature goes down. Simple! Right?

From the 2019 National Science Foundation article.

>Since scientists first determined that atmospheric carbon dioxide was lower during ice ages than during warm phases, they have looked at why, theorizing that it may be a function of ocean circulation, sea ice, iron-laden dust or temperature.

>Yet no computer model has been able to explain why CO2 levels were as much as one-third lower when an ice age settled in.

As of 2019, they had no explanation why CO2 went down, to drive temperature colder. This is a big omission, we cannot even understand major natural climate change, something as big as an ice age. Yet they want your Trillions$.

If they admit oceans cooled first absorbing CO2 (the 800 year lag), they'd have to admit CO2 does not drive temperature. And why it happens every 100kya like clockwork.

I have searched and search for a reasonable explanation of cooling, what reduced CO2, to start ice ages. I've seen iron particles, plants going into overdrive and the dog ate it. If anyone can find it, post it here.

She used an air pump, two glass cylinders, and four mercury-in-glass thermometers. In each cylinder, she placed two thermometers and then used the pump to evacuate the air from one cylinder and compress it in the other cylinder.

When both cylinders reached equal ambient temperatures, they were placed in the sunlight and temperature variances were measured. She also placed the containers in the shade for comparison and tested the temperature results by dehydrating one cylinder and adding water to the other, to measure the effect of dry versus moist air. 

Foote noted that the amount of moisture in the air impacted the temperature results. She performed this experiment on air, carbon dioxide (CO2) (which was called carbonic acid gas in her era), and hydrogen, finding that the tube filled with carbon dioxide became hotter than the others when exposed to sunlight. She wrote: ""The receiver containing this gas became itself much heated—very sensibly more so than the other—and on being removed [from the Sun], it was many times as long in cooling"".

We've discussed the lesser sea ice this Antarctic Winter, which reached a lesser max extent than past years, though exceeded the median extent line on the Western side (Peninsula, towards S. America) and a few other places. So let's review the other concern, the Ozone Hole (OH), which has recently been tied to Climate Change (CC), and in both directions.

First, it is humorous that when OH was smaller in 2019 than years since measurement began in the 1980's, the U.N. crowed, ""Fixed it by eliminating CFC's per Montreal Protocol"". Those reports are hard to find now since apparently buried and they are promoting a new story. The reason is that in following years OH was larger than ever and 2023 may turn out the largest still. They respun that by claiming models showed upper atmosphere circulations, due to CC (Polar Vortex, PV) cooled the Stratosphere, to form more ice crystals which decrease the ozone. This only occurs during Antarctic Winter, when almost no sun, so I've never understood the fuss about ""increased uV on ground"", thought the main concern was that OH would eventually extend to temperate latitudes. A 2019 link below claiming ""fixed 'er"", followed by a link with ""new 'xplainin"" (PV), plus blaming the even bigger OH in 2023 on the Tonga volcano:

[https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/16/current-ozone-hole-could-be-one-of-the-smallest-in-30-years-copernicus](https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/16/current-ozone-hole-could-be-one-of-the-smallest-in-30-years-copernicus)

[https://www.space.com/antarctic-ozone-hole-early-hunga-tonga](https://www.space.com/antarctic-ozone-hole-early-hunga-tonga)

This link argues the other way, that OH increase CC. They quote a scientist speculating that increased uV hitting the ice/ocean will significantly increase the radiant heat input from the sun. I say ""speculate"" because no link to calculations to support that claim. Relatively little energy in sunlight is in the uV. It is more a concern for skin cancer than radiant energy. There is little sunlight in Antarctic Winter when OH exists. Hopefully, more to come. I see too many unsupported CC claims which are never challenged, and predictions which are quickly forgotten (or buried) when they don't come true.

IT’S HARD TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE WHEN THE SCIENCE FOLLOWS THE PARTY LINE: [**How ‘Preapproved Narratives’ Corrupt Science: Especially in climate and Covid research, abuse of peer review and self-censorship abound.**](https://archive.ph/Yttxo)

>*Scientists were aghast last month when Patrick Brown, climate director at the Breakthrough Institute in Berkeley, Calif., acknowledged that he’d censored one of his studies to increase his odds of getting published. Credit to him for being honest about something his peers also do but are loath to admit.*  
*In an essay for the Free Press, Mr. Brown explained that he omitted “key aspects other than climate change” from a paper on California wildfires because such details would “dilute the story that prestigious journals like Nature and its rival, Science, want to tell.” Editors of scientific journals, he wrote, “have made it abundantly clear, both by what they publish and what they reject, that they want climate papers that support certain preapproved narratives.”*  
*Nature’s editor, Magdalena Skipper, denied that the journal has “a preferred narrative.” No doubt the editors at the New York Times and ProPublica would say the same of their own pages.*  
*Mr. Brown’s criticisms aren’t new. In 2005 Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis wrote an essay titled “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.” He contended that scientists “may be prejudiced purely because of their belief in a scientific theory or commitment to their own findings.” . . .*  
*Journals often don’t compensate peer reviewers, which can result in perfunctory work. The bigger problem is that reviewers often disregard a study’s flaws when its conclusions reinforce their own biases. One result is that “a large share of what is published may not be replicable or is obviously false,” Dr. Ioannidis notes. “Even outright fraud may be becoming more common.” . . .*  
*Scientific journals and preprint servers aren’t selective about research quality. They’re selective about the conclusions. If experts want to know why so many Americans don’t trust “science,” they have their answer. Too many scientists no longer care about science.*",climateskeptics

196,1696051574.0,We need MORE CO2 in our atmosphere and there is no climate “emergency”!,"Our current geologic period (Quaternary) has the lowest average CO2 levels in the history of the earth. It’s actually dangerously low. If it drops to 200ppm, it’s game over for humanity because all plant life will die on earth followed shortly by all animals and humans.  During the Jurassic period, CO2 levels were 2,000ppm and vegetation thrived. If we raised CO2 to 3,000ppm our crops would be so plentiful that we could feed the entire world. Scientists did a study on this by pumping different levels of CO2 into three separate greenhouses. The greenhouse with 3000ppm had corn that was triple the size of corn that was grown in a greenhouse with 400ppm. Corn is not the only crop that would flourish obviously in a higher CO2 environment obviously, ALL crops would flourish.  But I digress, this present warming trend actually started more than 300 years ago.  As I’ve stated several times, it was several degrees hotter during the 1100s and during Medieval times (1300s). If you go back 10,000 years there are also an additional three more periods when it was several more degrees warmer than it is today.  Interglacial periods usually last 10-15,000 years. Warming periods ALWAYS follow the end of the interglacial period. Our present period is 11,000 years old so we are at the end of it. This warming is to be expected. The last interglacial was 14 degrees warmer than today. The polar bears survived and Greenland didn’t melt. The current warming trend is not unusual. It’s to be expected.  We are actually living in one of the coldest periods of Earth’s history.  For most of Earth’s history, it was about 10C (18F) warmer than today.

197,1696076832.0,"The most simplistic blunder in ""climate science"" - Lambda","This is about an amazingly absurd mistake, that is yet not realized because people on the critical side are just stupid. To tell climate sensitivity you will not just need estimates on forcings and feedbacks, but also a conversion factor for W/m2 to temperature. This conversion factor is known as ""Lambda"".

Lambda has long been assumed to be 0.3, so that a forcing of 3.7W/m2 would translate into a 3.7 \* 0.3 = 1.11K temperature increase. But how do you get this 0.3 figure?

&#x200B;

[cess 1990](https://preview.redd.it/6ag849jezdrb1.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=daac3f879355d8b7d297705d9e590623346689e3)

It is derived from the assumption of 288K surface temperature and 240W/m2 in emissions TOA. If the temperature should increase by 1K, then how much more emissions would that mean? We calculate (289/288\^4 - 1) \* 240 = 3.35, and 1/3.35 = 0.3. Mathematically more accurate would be the first derivation of the SB equation.

P = T\^4 \* 5.67e-8

P' = 4 T\^3 \* 5.67e-8

4 \* 288\^3 \* 5.67e-8 = 5.418

Of course that would give us 5.418 and thus far more than 3.35. The reason is that at 288K bb-emissions are 390, not 240 of course. If we allow for it, we get 5.418 / 390 \* 240 = 3.334.

The obvious problem here is assuming a direct relation between surface temperature and emissions TOA. The whole GHE is about this not being true. It is not the surface at some 288K emitting 240W/m2, but predominatly the atmosphere at a much colder temperature. So emissions TOA have to be related to the actual emissions temperature of some 255K. Then however we get a different Lambda. (256/255\^4 - 1) \* 240 = 3.787 and 1 / 3.787 = 0.264. Or..

4 \* 255\^3 \* 5.67e-8 = 3.76

1 / 3.76 = 0.266

Superficially it does not seem to make much of a difference. 0.266 is about 11% less than 0.3, but that would not make it a game changer. That is unless you understand how climate sensitivity is calculated. The formula is..

ECS = forcing \* lambda / ( 1 - lambda \* feedbacks )

For instance AR6 assumes these feedbacks (central estimates):

1.8 WV

\-0.5 lapse rate

0.35 albedo

0.42 clouds

\-0.01 bio

With a CO2 forcing of 3.7, a lambda of 0.3 and a sum of these feedbacks of 2.06 we calculate..

3.7 \* 0.3 / ( 1 - 0.3 \* 2.06) = 2.9K

Using the correct lambda instead we get..

3.7 \* 0.266 / ( 1 - 0.266 \* 2.06) = 2.18K

Now that is a reduction of climate sensitivity by 25%, just because this little and obvious blunder. Alternatively it overstates ECS by 1/3 - and no one seems to care. Of course there are many more mistakes and the figures for forcing and feedbacks named above are all wrong, for different reasons.

I do not know, maybe it is just because such logical issues are harder to communicate that the ""critical side"" is focusing on ill-fated arguments instead. The consequences of flawed arguments however are..

a) consensus side being made look better than it is

199,1696045936.0,The IPCC is wrong,"1. The IPCC substantially underestimated the extent to which the land component of their global surface temperature data was contaminated by “urbanization bias”. Urbanization biases are localized warming effects affecting thermometer stations located in urban areas. Urban areas only account for 3-4% of the land surface and only about 2% of the planet’s surface, but urbanized stations represent the majority of the thermometer records (more than 75% of all stations and more than 85% of the longest thermometer records).

2.  The temperature data from outside of urban areas from multiple sources – long rural station records, ocean temperature records, tree ring temperature proxies and glacier length temperature proxies – show a more nuanced history of temperature changes since the mid-19th century. This non-urban data suggests temperatures have alternated between multi-decadal periods of warming and then of cooling and then warming. In contrast, the urban data suggests an almost continuous warming since the 19th century.

3.  The IPCC’s chosen estimates of the changes in solar activity (“total solar irradiance” or TSI for short) only represented a small subset of those used by the scientific community. Several of the TSI estimates the IPCC had neglected in their analysis suggest that most of the warming since the 19th century could be natural – especially from the non-urbanized data. Others suggest that the warming has been a mixture of natural and human-caused factors. Others agree with the IPCC’s attribution statements.

Localized climate change question? Ever since I was young, I have heard of global warming, and frankly it's excited me, I live in Alaska and I want to grow fruit trees, sort of a northern Jonny Appleseed. I went into science and got an engineering degree, so I can do know basic math. Anyway, I started going through public weather data from USGS for the small town that I live in on excel and frankly for the life of me I can't see warming in my hometown. With a warming rate of approx. .14 F per decade worldwide it seems like by now it should start to beat out local effects. I have data back to 1950 so I have 70 years of daily high and lows. I believe it's happening I'm more annoyed that I can't actually see it in the data I've looked for. Currently I have a cooling trend of about -.12 F per decade Anyway, I guess I'm either living in the wrong spot or maybe my math is bad. I was thinking I'd put the weather station data into a neural net and train in up and run climate predictions from it, maybe that way I can at least have an estimate of the trend but right now I'm confident it will be negative.

Anyway, I want to know of a prediction model that gives localized results. Ideally by zip code or a weather station specific forecast.

I know global climate is not local climate. I know about heat island effects and corrections. I know about weather stations changing sensors. I am aware that I am not a climate scientist.

Edit 2: I know this whole post may sound like trolling, but I'm honestly bummed that I don't seem to have warming where I'm at, it's just kind of vaguely disappointing. It does though make me wonder a bit about the entire thing but that's not really my focus, I just wanted it to get warmer it seems exciting.

Edit 3: I was getting the .14 drop per decade put going back though it I see that was using alot of empty data because the weather station was offline.  So, there's less data than I thought.  So, for the yearly I dropped any year that had any missing data.  I also didn't get banned by a person, it was automatic like maybe a filter, like I had the wrong keywords, it was just too fast.  Maybe This is just a fluke I'll look at Juneau's and see maybe if it's how I do this.

228,000,000,000 trees * 0.0218 metric tons/tree = 4,974,400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide absorbed per year.

Now, let's compare this to the carbon dioxide emissions in the United States in 2021, which was approximately 6,340.2 million metric tons:

6,340.2 million metric tons = 6,340,200 metric tons.

To calculate the percentage of carbon that trees in the United States are estimated to be absorbing compared to the carbon dioxide emissions:

(4,974,400,000 metric tons / 6,340,200 metric tons) * 100% ≈ 78.6%

So, the corrected calculation estimates that trees in the United States are absorbing approximately 78.6% of the carbon dioxide emissions. This suggests that, based on the given values, the United States is a net absorber of carbon dioxide through its trees.",climateskeptics

276,1695669894.0,WSJ tries to link climate change to a challenging 2023 farming campaign.,"WSJ tries to link climate change to a challenging 2023 farming campaign. 

*Some agriculture officials expect that summers with more severe weather events, from heat waves to droughts, could be even more common in the coming years as a result of a changing climate.*

The importance of data in 2023 cannot be understated. It allows one to remain objective when prices are jumping around and weather forecasts are rapidly shifting. The Wall Street Journal article does a good job of covering several topics, but it weaves in a misplaced narrative.

2023 was a unique year and up-and-down campaign for America’s producers. Summers are hot, and seeds resist stress better than ever before. But, the data shows that stress during critical periods makes record crops and limits the upside. This year’s crops were exposed to stress early in the season due to dry weather and localized heat.

June and July received better precipitation after one of the driest planting campaigns on record. July’s two-week forecast kept showing extreme heat that never materialized. The July pollination window is the critical period when hot temperatures will severely retard the development of ears. This critical period was dry but, more importantly, cool.

Conversely, late August and early September for soybeans were extremely dry and experienced pockets of above-average temperatures. This is the critical pod-filling period.

The USDA has been slow to cut yield forecasts, which is normal. Soybean forecasts are likely too optimistic today, but this is not the market’s focus. Poor demand and South American production are the critical questions going forward.

*Agriculture Department crop reports are estimates but have historically been on target.*

The USDA reports are the estimates of the market trades. The accuracy of the estimates is not traded or priced as a stand-alone event. The markets' interpretation results from a broader range of inputs, including demand updates and historical revisions. How many soybeans are produced is priced in the context of how many were left over and how many are expected to disappear.

*During hot periods, feedlot operators need temperatures to stay in the mid-60s for about five hours at night so the cattle can cool down. About four days in the 90s and nights in the 70s could result in deaths, according to feedlot operators.*

Livestock producers are focused on the cost of gain, and hot (or cold weather) will have an impact. But deaths are generally rare. Animals suffering from ongoing stress combined with high humidity and extreme heat could create a devastating combination. It is doubtful that a few days, as outlined above, will prove fatal.

Only a couple of years ago, these same climate change articles focused on the cows' carbon footprint as the cause of the extreme weather. Now, there are circular links that their deaths are becoming the result.

Weather forecasting has improved over time but is still an unknown. Farmers can use their experience, objective data, and weather forecasts to mitigate risks to crops and animals. Low-cost tools and improved access to technology can help reduce the impact of heat waves and droughts. But the risks these seasonal weather patterns pose are not going away. Climate change has very little to do with it.",climateskeptics

[https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/31158/](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/31158/)

Even then this needs to be taken with a lot of salt. The problem is a claimed average loss of 147Gt a year is just 0.0006% of that ice sheet. At that rate it would take 170,000 years for it to melt away. Equally this would correspond to a 4cm/century sea level rise. These figures are very low and well within the margin of error. Indeed there is research suggesting rather an overall growth trend of the ice sheet..

[https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/17/2059/2023/](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/17/2059/2023/)

The overall problem however is a general lack of warming below 45°S. It is something ""climate science"" can not explain and so a lot of scientific and non-scientific BS is circulating on the subject. In the current instance pointing out sea ice loss, while ignoring ice sheet gains, could serve as a typical example. But there is a lot more.

At least West Antarctica is warming at rates climate scientists like, so it has to serve as evidence of model projections being right. The problem is, most of the warming there is due to models. There are simply no temperature records dating back and so the temperature was reconstructed with models. No, I am not kidding you. It is models confirming models. It makes no sense anyway, because why would ""climate change"" excempt all of the very south of Earth, just with the exception of West Antarctica?

Here is a very interesting paper by Schmidt, Hansen and others, where they speculate on how to fix the problem.

*""Here we demonstrate that including a realistic increase in Antarctic meltwater can improve a model's representation of SO trends. We use an ensemble of simulations of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Earth system model.* ***Model results suggest that Antarctic meltwater drives a cooling and freshening of the SO and an expansion of winter sea ice***\*, all consistent with observations. Results suggest that a better representation of Antarctic ice melt should be included in climate models.""\*

[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL086892](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019GL086892)

What they suggest is, that the lack of warming of the southern ocean could be explained by Antartic meltwater. Of course, since the Antarctic is not warming either, there is not enough meltwater observed. But if it could be ""found"" (meaning fudged), then the models could possibly reproduce the lack of warming.

PS. one might pay special attention to the named ""expansion of winter sea ice"" in that 2020 paper. They tried to find an explanation as to why the sea ice was NOT declining. Now that it temporarilly does, the alarmists go like ""WE TOLD YOU SO!"" ;)))

It hits on the daytime side at a very high temperature then spreads out to a blackbody average of -18C. This average necessarily is not at the surface, but somewhere between the surface and the top of the troposphere.

Higher pressure, hotter temperature at the surface is balanced by less density and gravitational potential of energy of airmasses at the top of the troposphere. This potential energy will convert into the adiabatic compression of gas, heating the extreme latitudes.

Simple gas laws and the lapse rate caused by gravity crossed with the mass of the atmosphere fully explain the surface temperature.

There is zero room for a radiative greenhouse effect that heats the Earth from -18C. First, it's absurd to think the surface temperature starts at -18C.

Second, it's absurd to think an INSULATING effect can add heat, like a heat source, to -18C. That's not how insulation works.

But overall, this effect is precluded by the basic parameters and simple gas and gravity laws.

How can you possibly still believe in this nonsense?

We can also invoke the second law of thermodynamics and see that radiative energy is a matter of density of energy and packets expressed as certain frequencies, and that colder air cannot actually add energy to a hotter surface and will not effect net heat flux.

Why is this so hard?

There are a number of factors that contribute to the uncertainty in climate models. One factor is the lack of observational data. Climate models rely on observational data to calibrate and validate their predictions. However, observational data is not always available, and it can be difficult to collect accurate observational data in some regions of the world.

&#x200B;

Another factor that contributes to the uncertainty in climate models is the complexity of the climate system. The climate system is a complex system that involves a large number of interacting factors, such as the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. It is difficult to accurately model all of these factors and their interactions.

&#x200B;

Finally, climate models are also affected by the assumptions that are made about the future. Climate models are based on our understanding of the climate system and our assumptions about how the climate system will change in the future. However, these assumptions are not always accurate, and they can lead to uncertainty in the model predictions.

&#x200B;

Despite the uncertainty in climate models, they are still the best tools we have for predicting future impacts on the climate. Climate models are used by scientists to assess the potential impacts of climate change on different regions and sectors of society. They are also used to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies.

&#x200B;

It is important to note that climate models are not designed to predict specific weather events, such as hurricanes or heat waves. Climate models are designed to predict long-term climate trends, such as the average global temperature.

&#x200B;

Climate modeling is an evolving field of science, and climate models are becoming more accurate over time. As our understanding of the climate system improves, climate models will become more reliable and useful for predicting future impacts on the climate.",climateskeptics

Imagine a pendulum. When it swings back to return to it's starting position, that's one cycle. A second pendulum could swing higher, but return to start in the same time. That would mean a higher amplitude.

If it returns faster, that's higher frequency.

Once you relate the abstracted base unit of time to another time frame, you can derive a wavelength.

Imagine now that a pendulum had physical bracers limiting its amplitude because it would hit them instead of going higher. Molecules are like this. There is a limit on wave amplitude due to the constraints of molecular structure. Photon-waves move at the speed of light, so wavelength becomes a moot point, it's just representative of frequency. Frequency is how energy is expressed in molecular vibrations.

A photon-wave with given energy has a frequency. At that frequency, because time and amplitude are fixed, molecules are limited in how much energy they can contain.

Only when frequency is increased, can more energy be stored.

This is why the spectral density of a radiating object has a long tail. The lower wavelength energies saturate. No more energy can be stored at that frequency, and this partly defines the relationship between radiative energy and temperature.

If you have an object at a very low temperature and its hit by high energy thermal radiation, then the wave energy will distribute, it will conduct into the local medium.

The problem is that low energy molecules have lower frequency, it takes longer for them to shed their energy state to the point of resonance where the higher frequency can be absorbed. This creates an energy dam, and further explains the long tail. While energetic molecules will radiate thermal radiation, they also conduct down into less energetic molecules within the medium. Since less energetic molecules radiate more slowly, they persist a bit longer.

This defines the shape of the spectral curve. The height at a given wavelength is related to how long it takes to radiate. Higher frequencies radiate faster, and so can resonantly absorb energy more frequently. As energy adds to the medium over a unit of time, it stacks up within a wavelength position, then dams up, and then higher energy density is attained in the next lower wavelength position.

When radiation from colder bodies reaches a warmer body, it is not absorbed in the lower wavelength positions where most of the energy is stored. It might be absorbed in the lower portions, but all this will do is shore up the dam, causing energy which would have conducted into a lower frequency state to remain at a higher frequency.

Mechanically, there is no net transfer of energy. It's either not absorbed, or if it is absorbed in a limited fashion, it facilitates a more rapid loss of energy until the old equilibrium is reached.

In two other scenarios, if the higher frequency energy is added, it will stack at the shorter wavelength positions in the curve, and the object will heat.

If net transfer of energy in the ambient environment is altered at the lower end of the spectrum, where that energy is removed, it will cool rapidly.

However, when an object is in a local equilibrium where the lower end of the spectrum is in a net exchange with its environment that is balanced, and the hotter end is radiating, then if you add energy to the middle of the spectrum it will have no net change to the system.

You have to cut throught the crap. Radiation has energy. Wavelength represents a frequency, which has to resonate with the vibration of a molecule for there to be an absorption of energy. Higher frequencies are absorbed, lower frequencies cannot be absorbed. It's a one way entropy street.

Do you notice how there's a relationship between power flux and wavelength? Like, how higher frequency contributes more energy in a given unit of time? You know, basic common sense.

What most people don't consider is how the temperature of a thing is related to a spectral density. If you have 200K equivalent energy, it can only attain a certain height of radiant flux. Add 100K more energy, you get more flux, and so a more dense packet of energy. Higher frequency, smaller wavelength.

When CO2's opacity window re-emits to the hot surface, this is not a flow of discrete energy. This is a packet of energy of a certain quality, with a certain density. 

The lower wavelengths of emission at the surface are not affected by these higher wavelengths.

If we imagine that some part of the spectrum which would have shed energy is replaced by re-radiation, then it only means that local energy which would have replaced that pocket had the re-radiation not filled it, is instead radiated out in exact proportion.

This is why colder objects cannot radiatively interfere with the net flow of energy from a hotter object. The higher energy pockets of the hot object dominate the energy dynamics. You cannot impinge on that dominance with less energetic influence.

This is also common sense, the infamous ""violation of the 2d law of thermodynamics"". You can't have heat accumulate from cold objects to hot. That would be a funhouse mirror universe.

Things only cool, without a heat source.

469,1694681430.0,can you please debunk my uneducated argument?,"So I was thinking about all climate mechanisms. And it seems to me that it doesn't work at all like climate alarmists say it works. It doesn't seem to work at all like science in general says it works.

Air doesn't warm through radiation forcing but primarily through conduct and convection. So greenhouse gases are virtually irrelevant for climate. I argued about this with ChatGPT, and we agreed in a *radiator in a room* scenario, but when I took the conversation to the atmosphere, it got messy. It still admitted that convection is more important than radiative forcing from greenhouse gases, but only in the short run.

The air composition can suggest how this is true, because only  around 2% of it can capture radiation (water vapor is included in this 2%) while its entirety can warm through conduct. And air is very fluid (it can mix with itself well) so convection is very effective.

This is my theory, and I call it *my* theory because I haven't ever seen it being discussed from other skeptics. It's supported by the historical evidence and it makes sense. Also it's an argument that can destroy the climate crisis narrative.

But because I haven't seen this argument elsewhere, I suspect that there must be something wrong with it and I am not seeing it. So please try to debunk it. Show me what's wrong about it.

Yes, it is simplified. If you go up in the atmosphere, the lapse rate eventually turns around and a part of the photosphere is actually within the stratosphere. Also there is an atmospheric window. Furthermore one could discuss its magnitude, as the surface is not a perfect emitter (neither are GHGs) and likely it is only about 27K (287-260). Anyway..

Yet it depicts the two vital components, emission altitude and lapse rate. The altitude of the photosphere depends on the absorbing stuff within the atmosphere (GHGs, clouds, aerosols). The lapse rate largely depends on the ideal gas law, but will be influenced by latent heat (condensation of WV) and to a lesser degree by radiative exchanges. Both can change. Moreover the lapse rate can not just shift, but also rotate. With more water vapor the lapse rate will shrink (become steeper in the diagram) and that will also reduce the GHE. It is called ""LRF"" (lapse rate feedback) and is negative.

By comparison ""energy budget models"" are not very helpful in teaching the GHE. They contain a lot of stuff totally irrelevant, but exclude the vital mechanism. Naturally that is causing a lot of confusion, next to some persisting ""back radiation"" nonsense.

\- The radiative exhange underneath the photosphere may have some minor influence of the lapse rate, but is otherwise irrelevant.

\- The surface is NOT heated by ""back radiation"", nor is the atmosphere heated by upwelling surface radiation, and most definitely they do not heat each other in a perpetuum mobile kind of physics.

\- Without GHGs the lapse rate would NOT turn to zero nor the atmosphere isothermic.

\- Processes like evaporation and condensation of WV (latent heat) or sensible heat influence the lapse rate, but otherwise do not matter. For those obsessed with balances, yes they tend to balance (thus the name), but the fact they do, will not tell you if a company is doing fine or not, or why it is doing so. Neither will a ""surface energy balance"" tell you why the surface is as warm as it is.

\- Most importantly however, this is an isolated view in the emission side. The GHE does NOT take into account the SW properties of the atmosphere which contributes most of Earth's albedo. If we would discuss an intergrated view over LW AND SW effects of the atmosphere, then this ""atmosphere effect"" would only amount to about 8K. This contrasts the notion that without atmosphere Earth would be 255K cold. That is not true, for many reasons btw.

[Direct solar Irradiance over 24 hours, displays a parabola which begins at 0 and peaks at 6 hours before dropping back to 0 at 12 hours and remaining 0 until the end of the 24 hour period.](https://preview.redd.it/md78ky9uf2ob1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ed480d8405541b5b063f1f5367b2963bfef13f)

\*\*Calculations:\*\* The expected similarity of calculations based on averages compared to recorded and simulated/integrated results.

&#x200B;

For global blackbody calculations, the figure (Θ )/4  (where theta = the solar constant) for the solar insulation at the earth's surface, for my purposes I need to find the average of a cylinder, because my sim lacks seasons and latitude differences in insolation. This is easily done, for spheres you take the total insolation of the area of the silhouette of the sphere (a circle) divided by the surface area of the sphere: Θ(πr\\\^2)/(4πr\\\^2 )=Θ/4  . 

&#x200B;

For a cylinder, I take the total insolation of a rectangle with a width equal to 2r and divide it by the surface area of a cylinder without caps Θ2rh / 2πrℎ = Θ / π. 

For my sim I assumed 1050 W/m2 sunlight of insolation from direct sunlight filtering through the atmosphere, this is an average of 334.225 W/m2 across my simulated day night cycle. I assumed an albedo of .07 and an emissivity of .984 for my sea water. Using the Stephen-Boltzmann law I calculate my average surface temperature to be 273.203 K, or just over 0 C.

The final equation: ( (1050 / π) \* (.93 / .984) )  / σ ) \^ (1/4) = T

where σ is 5.67 x 10\^(-8)

The mean temperature of the simulation will come out very slightly lower because of the TVEB factor caused by the diurnal cycle, this should be quite small because of the thermal capacity of the water. Notably, this estimated temperature is much too cold for a tropical sea which is going to be difficult for the ""back-radiation doesn't exist"" crowd.

The temperature dropped over the course of about 70 years to settle at an average daily temperature of 273.203 degrees, +/- .008 degrees K. (I only graphed 50 years of this because the change after this point is very small and the TVEB factor of this result is so small that it is rounded out, < 0.001 degrees). This is above the freezing point of sea water, but this is calculated using highly idealized tropical conditions and lacking most cooling forces. Clearly, this isn't good enough. What should I add to the model next to make it more accurate?

Aldous had access to diaries and meeting minutes, and this paints a very interesting picture, with striking parallels seen today.

Perhaps we can learn from their efforts and successes?

In the early 80s, we were all terrified of the Russians, perhaps even worse than now. We were afraid to die of mutual nuclear destruction. In my home country of the Netherlands people sung about ""[the bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jw9i0bu7PyQ)"", the atomic bombs we all expected to be dropped. We had over a million people protesting against Reagan's plan to store nuclear weapons in the Netherlands.

In the light of how the Russians had invaded Poland, Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia, the left's solution to mutual destruction, unilateral nuclear disarmament, could only be seen as naïve. By getting rid of nuclear weapons we were going to show the Russians they had nothing to fear. Reagan and Thatcher on the other hand (and our governing Dutch coalition at the time) were seen by the media as lunatics who were going to provoke the Russians, causing WW3.

Reagan, strongly supported by Thatcher, faced the enemy, started an arms race, made up space based anti-ballistics measures (SDI) and brought the Soviets to their knees. It certainly helped that the Soviets had a leader who was open to debate and who understood the problems he was facing. We can only wonder about what would have happened if we had listened to the left.

We now see an interesting parallel, with the left being utterly terrified of CO2 (-> Soviets), which is going to lead to destruction of the world as we know it. They want to ban CO2  (unilateral nuclear disarmament), which is likely going to bankrupt and break our societies, while not causing any climate reversal whatsoever.

A big difference today is that Biden, Sunak, Rutten, and pretty much every other head of state are behind the anti-CO2 bandwagon. Is there anyone who can unite world leaders to stop this madness?

The Danes and Finn and Norwegians had their own methods, Not sure about the US method. But the overall estimate was about 25,000. These are not sheep!

549,1694293572.0,How I became a Climate Skeptic,"I'll try to keep this as short as possible...17 years ago, I watched a film called *""An Inconvenient Truth""* (I know, I know) at my in-laws while having dinner. Our first son was just born. I was horrified, what are we doing? What have we done? I was sold, I was a believer.

I'm an Engineering type, Project Manager, think critically and generally interested in history, nature, science and geology as 'hobbies'. I don't lean politically hard one way or the other, more a centrist (I don't live in the USA).

That night I went home, started reading everything I could get my hands on, I needed to know everything about this problem, my new born child might depend on it.

Of course Google, but also actual published scientic papers, blogs, NOAA, NASA, etc, etc. I actually hunted down the source material used in articles and *opinion* pieces, I wanted the hard facts, the cold *truth*. 

In many cases, statistical information presentations I found out are based on models or assumptions with no disclaimer. Then statistical manipulation, splicing, dicing, adjustments or outright discarding of data that did not fit, or questionable data points...that old quote...*""With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk""*.

It took a few months, but the more I read, the more I started seeing all the *cracks*, half truths, exaggerations or just downright innuendo. Not to mention the political messaging and weaponized *clubbing* of people to death with it.

There came a point where I felt lied to, manipulated, propagandized. If I tried to talk to people, I was a climate denier, uneducated, a right-wing nut job.

All the peices fell into place. At first I was shy, kept my 'concerns' to myself. But now, I'm happy to tell anyone. My readings have left me extremely educated on the issue, it's easy to defend with a clear conscience. Even the words ""climate skeptic"" bother me, it's a missbranding, if anything, I'm ""climate confident""'

To be clear, climate change does happen, the earth has warmed in the last century, sea levels have risen several millimeters. I just do not see this as the number one problem facing the planet, or the minimal contribution CO2 has made. Money & time could be put to much better uses. Nor do I see politicians, who cannot even feed/protect thier own populus, be the saviours by sending them tons of money (they can't even get basic stuff right).

Thanks for listing, perhaps many of you share the same journey.",climateskeptics

The idea is run off solar during the day and use the free power at night... and in between free power and good sunlight I will shut down all big draw items.

Renewables (solar and wind) are neither profitable, nor a good future bet.","Ironically, those who simultaneously are trying to convince us that renewables are more efficient and effective than fossil fuels are the first to decry the fact that fossil fuels receive far more investment:

> ...investments in renewable energy are dwarfed by those in fossil fuels. Considering upstream, downstream and infrastructure investments,6  fossil fuel capital investments – with an average USD 991 billion invested annually between 2015 and 2022 – were almost **three times higher** than renewable energy investments – estimated at an average USD 360 billion annually (Figure 1.3).

Furthermore, the world's 60 largest banks invested **$742 billion in fossil fuels** in 2021. Compare this to **$34.5 billion for renewables**.

It's worth noting that JP Morgan has made numerous statements about how they don't believe in the economic viability of renewables.

Private equity is similar, and even more telling since there is a greater focus on profitability and less on public image. Private equity investment in fossil fuels continues to grow while they drop renewables, recognizing that not even intense government subsidization make wind and solar economically viable. According to S&P Global, private equity invested  **$11.92 billion in fossil fuels** during the first five months of 2022 versus **$8.81 billion in renewables**.

*The Economist* claims that in 2020-2021, private equity firms bought **$60 billion of fossil-fuel assets** versus **$45 billion for renewables**.

We do not yet understand abrupt climate changes well enough to predict them. The models used to project future climate changes and their impacts are not especially good at simulating the size, speed, and extent of the past changes, casting uncertainties on assessments of potential future changes. Thus, it is likely that climate surprises await us.

696,1693802154.0,What makes a molecule IR active? A discussion from /u/2oftenRight,"What makes a vibrational mode IR active? Well, since IR radiation has a very long wavelength (around 10 um), and molecules are much smaller than that (large ones are 1 nm), on the size scale of a molecule, IR radiation is like a uniform oscillating electromagnetic field. This means that if a vibrational mode does not couple to a uniform oscillating electromagnetic field, that vibrational mode will be unable to absorb or emit IR waves. In order for that to happen, the vibrational mode must result in an oscillation of the molecules dipole moment. [Here](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Map%3A_Organic_Chemistry_(Wade\)_Complete_and_Semesters_I_and_II/Map%3A_Organic_Chemistry_(Wade\)/11%3A_Infrared_Spectroscopy_and_Mass_Spectrometry/11.03%3A_IR-Active_and_IR-Inactive_Vibrations) is a chemistry textbook entry on the topic. If a vibration does not cause the dipole moment to oscillate, that vibration is not IR active. How many vibrational modes do molecules have? Linear molecules have 3N-5 and all other molecules have 3N-6. So since N2 is linear, it has 3M-5 or 6-5=1 vibrational mode. This is pretty straight forward, as the only way two atoms can vibrate is by stretching and compressing the only bond in the molecule. There is no way two atoms can bend or twist. Since N2 only has one vibrational mode, if that one vibrational mode is not IR active, then the molecule N2 will not absorb IR light. A stretching and compressing vibration of a symetric molecule does not result in a changing dipole moment, so the vibration is IR inactive. Since N2 has no other vibrational modes to be IR active, the N2 molecule does not interact with IR, by which I mean absorb or emit IR radiation due to coupling with vibrational modes. Again why? Simply because there are no modes that IR radiation can couple to. Happy to answer anyone's questions on what it IR inactive means, what vibrational modes are, and all the of the consequences of this science.",climateskeptics

698,1693768039.0,Why The “Effective Emissions Height Rises” Thing Is BS,"The warmists assume the pressure-density gradient precedes any warming or energy input. Sabine Hossenfelder demonstrates this idiocy by trying to attribute the density gradient to the inverse square law on the acceleration of gravity.

They then attribute the temperature gradient exclusively to a re-radiative back radiation effect where, among other things, the laws of entropy are violated and gases like N2 are not considered able to radiate much on their own.

Even though they derive the temperature gradient from this, they temporarily ignore that and then through pure radiative budget math, recognize that more greenhouse gas would raise the height of effective emissions according to their calculation of re-radiative heat trapping.

In real life (where this effect doesn’t occur, but if it somehow did) a higher height of effective emissions would mean hotter temps higher, and an intrinsically, necessarily balanced energy budget. More greenhouse gas should make the surface hotter FIRST AND IMMEDIATELY and only then will the temperature gradient rise. Once the temperature gradient rises fully, finally, the effective height of emissions will rise.

But they ignore temperature when calculating radiative effects.

Once they have the new height of effective emissions, then they point to the temperature gradient as it exists in real life, and claim that the upper atmosphere is too cold so it radiates less efficiently. Finally this is how they claim the energy budget is imbalanced, and then magic someday warming is thought to result.

So to recap, they ignore the temperature effects of pressure, take the density gradient for granted as of gravity alone creates it, imagine a physically impossible back-radiative heat trapping, attribute the temperature gradient (which is caused by pressure in real life) to this trapping, then ignore temperature to calculate a rise in height of emissions, then ignore their own theory of temperature gradient to attribute an energy imbalance to this, then use the energy imbalance to threaten the Earth with hidden someday warming they don’t have to exactly identify or explain.

Great theory you have there.

Not to mention that they use inaccurate starting conditions for the energy budget to contrive a too cold Earth which needs greenhouse warming, but then treat an insulating effect (re-radiation) as a HEAT SOURCE.

Guys greenhouse theory is bullshit. Don’t give any respect to people who defend it and that includes Roy Spencer, Willis Eschenbach, Judith Curry and Anthony Watts.

Climate scientists have greatly underestimated the uncertainty of proxy based reconstructions and hence have been overconfident in their models. We have shown that time dependence in the temperature series is sufficiently strong to permit complex sequences of random numbers to forecast out-of-sample reasonably well fairly frequently (see, for example, Figure 9). Furthermore, even proxy based models with approximately the same amount of reconstructive skill (Figures 11,12, and 13), produce strikingly dissimilar historical backcasts: some of these look like hockey sticks but most do not (Figure 14). Natural climate variability is not well understood and is probably quite large. It is not clear that the proxies currently used to predict temperature are even predictive of it at the scale of several decades let alone over many centuries.

Meaning the 20 year old protestor who blocks streets, to the global elitist billionaire who goes on TV to lecture us all.  The climate alarmists are hypocrites. The ""Just stop oil"" protestors literally drove their gas-guzzling car to the meetup in order to join dozens of other protestors to block the street and hold their ""Just stop oil"" banners.

&#x200B;

The left wing young people who are the loudest about their opinions won't give up their products made from oil and oil byproducts. And they happily keep their homes at a comfortable 72 degrees.  The millionaires who are worried about rising sea levels literally own mansions on the coast. They don't seem to worried. If they truly believed their alarmist worldview they would be selling their homes and moving inland, to higher ground. If I lived by a volcano and was worried it would erupt soon and kill my entire family and burn all my belongings I would leave immediately. But not these climate alarmists who willingly and happily live by a deadly natural body, risking their billion dollar homes to flooding and rising sea levels.  

The politicians and other talking heads literally own private jets and fly around to ""climate conferences"" where they put more pollution into the air in a single trip than I ever will in my entire life with my 4 cylinder small vehicle.  Why are they all such hypocrites? Turn off your AC and heater. Start riding your bicycle around. Get rid of your private jet. Sell your coastal home. Stop buying clothes, electronics, vehicles, plastics, and other things that are created by oil and oil byproducts.  

Put your money where your mouth is.  

Lead by example. 

Why do you need the rest of us to change our ways before you change yours? Why do you need the government to step in and create some laws and policies? You can already do things that will, in your view, save the planet and the human race. And it's not just a few of them: it's roughly half the population of the major nations on the planet. For example, in the USA, it's roughly all the left leaning/Democrats who smugly condemn you for your lack of alarmism. That's half the country. That's hundreds of millions of people. And that's just USA. There's also like-minded people in other western countries: Canada, countries in western Europe, Australia.  

With such a large group of people, they could (according to their worldview) easily make drastic changes to the environment and planet and literally save the human race from extinction if they would collectively take up the task of changing their lifestyles and stop relying on coal and oil. But they don't and they won't. 

 Instead, they do nothing, while smugly pointing the figure at non-alarmist centrists/right-wing people for their lack of action. It's so hypocritical.  

Why do you need the rest of us to act before you act? Just start acting yourselves. Lead by example. Give up your electronics, most of your clothes, smart phone, and car. Keep your house at 80 degrees in the summer and don't turn on the heater in the winter to reduce stress on the electrical grid and reliance on coal plants which are, in your view, literally killing the human race.  

They talk down on you like you're stupid if you don't buy into the alarmist mindset. They feel smug and superior, even though they aren't scientists, because they just brainlessly and mindlessly make the decision to agree with and tout the alarmist narratives. They feel intelligent by osmosis. ""Well, if some scientists on TV say to believe in climate alarmism, I guess I will! And I will feel smug and superior to my fellow man who doesn't buy into the alarmism.""  

Apparently, they are smarter than non-alarmist people, but apparently not smart enough to actually do anything about it. Are they incapable? No. They are perfectly capable of changing their lifestyles, leading by example, and showing the rest of us how great it is and how much their efforts are saving the planet and the human race. They could easily lead by persuasion and prove the rest of us wrong. or at least persuade us and recruit us to their side.  

But they can't, they don't, and they won't.

🚨 Plastic pollution has become a pressing concern, not only on land but also in our precious oceans. Yet, let's remember that addressing this issue doesn't mean disregarding the responsible use of versatile synthetic materials. Plastics play a vital role, especially in healthcare and the battle against infectious diseases in hospitals.

🏥 The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the indispensable role of plastics in modern healthcare. We've learned the hard way how shortages of essential gear like disposable gloves, masks, shields, gowns, and more affected healthcare personnel in North America and Europe. Governments even went head-to-head, outbidding one another for overpriced supplies from China, where many Western manufacturers had moved production. This unnecessary crisis stemmed from avoidable supply shortages.

🔍 Let's take a moment to imagine the repercussions of abruptly halting the use of plastic's main ingredient: oil. It's a reminder that while we tackle plastic pollution, we must also appreciate the responsible applications of these materials that contribute to our well-being.",climateskeptics

Well, someone has to replace Dr. Paul Ehrlich as the master of disaster, the climate doom prognosticator, the fossil fuel eliminator, government policy dominator, CO2 adjudicator.

Thomas Malthus was wrong, Ehrlich has been and is wrong, and this guy.... well he'll never have to answer for being wrong.

822,1693331755.0,Controversial: Nothing will ever be gained by debating climate science,"For reference, I don't believe anything substantial is going on with the climate.

I can tell when people are trying really hard to convince me of something that simply doesn't stand up.

Instead of confronting the firehose of climate fear, let's get to why they are pushing a narrative that doesn't stand up. Because if it doesn't stand up, you can bet the people at the very top, doing all the funding and coordination, are doing it for some other reason.

Is it for totalitarian control? That is obviously what is happening, but can't be the core reason: society is already well under control and voluntarily accepting ever more control.

If they want to phase out hydrocarbons in order to supposedly reduce emissions, how about we ignore that stated reason and explore other reasons for phasing out oil/gas.

Regardless of where oil comes from or how much remains in the ground, we have always been able to extract enough to meet global demand (excepting geopolitical events). Let's speculate that because we logically started with all the easy, surface oil and now we're into a lot of unconventional, deep and awkward oil, maybe this high-hanging fruit can't be plucked fast enough to cover the increasing declines of large, mature, conventional fields that we discovered in the 20th century and represent the overwhelming majority of all the oil we know to exist.

Let's also assume that if any fields are being replenished with abiotic oil, it's not happening fast enough to make any difference. And that even if barrel prices went to $500, that doesn't guarantee that a decline in global production can be reversed.

So the global economy has a big potential problem if other energy sources are unable to cover for declining oil production, and are themselves running into limits due to unsustainable mining.

**WHAT WOULD THE IDEAL SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM LOOK LIKE?**

You're the establishment and you know prolonged economic decline is on the cards.

That means without a comprehensive digital grip on society, your established rule is under threat.

How do you expand control over society during a period in which you should be losing control?

The answer is to sell the control as necessary to save the planet and improve lives.

Conveniently, oil consumption produces emissions which plausibly affect the planet.

This means you now have a justification for dismantling the economy, concealing any scarcity of oil supply.

You destroy demand for oil only a little bit faster than the natural decline would force lower consumption.

It is managed decline instead of chaotic decline.

During this decline, you erode most freedoms while acquiring granular, precise control of society.

Leveraging climate fear and celebration of ending the negative results of oil consumption, such as dirty air, congestion and microplastics.

For the longest possible time, you must sustain the illusion of the green renewable transition. That ensures a division between green optimists and the resistance, who are optimistic about defeating the WEF and getting back to normal.

Both are misguided, and both will fall into the digital trap to fill their bellies, avoid cold/heat, go online, or be able to travel.

Debating climate science is part of what they want both sides to waste time on. Everybody should be preparing for scarcity and reducing reliance on the grid, healthcare system, supermarkets, the internet and anything that requires fuel.

823,1693353434.0,The CO2 forcing Hockey Stick,"People do not know that. 

2xCO2 forcing is believed to be about 3.7W/m2, which combined with an assumed Lambda of 0.3 (also wrong) would result in 1.1K warming due to doubling CO2 alone. Then various feedbacks, with a lot of uncertainty, would come into play and get us to 3K +/-1.5K or so climate sensitivity.

What you might hear from ""critical scientists"" are arguments like..

\- CO2 would be saturating (undisputed, hence the logarithmic shape of CO2 forcing)

\- 1.1K is very little. Well, that is about how you define ""little"".

\- or doubling CO2 would only increase the energy budget by 1% (Lindzen for instance).

With these and similar arguments they implicitly endorse the consensus position of the 3.7W/m2 2xCO2 forcing, and that is the figure that matters. Terms like ""little"", ""only"" or ""saturation"" on the other side are meaningless and irrelevant.

Now what no one realized is that those 3.7W/m2, given the logarithmic shape of CO2 forcing, represent a hockey stick on their right. This figure is indeed inconsistent with the basic logarithmic function of CO2 forcing otherwise. For instance at a concentration of 280ppm CO2 is meant to contribute about 20W/m2 to the GHE SFR (single factor removal, net, excluse - whatever you want to call it). 

Following this logarithmic function a doubling of CO2 will only yield 2.15W/m2, not 3.7W/m2. It means either the GHE and / or its attribution is wrong, or the 2xCO2 forcing. Both can not be right. It is an epic blunder right the center of the ""science"", and again, like it some many instances, not a single ""critical expert"" ever took notice.

826,1693331821.0,Climate change and wildfires in Canada,"Climate change is becoming the default explanation for all bad weather, plus a lot of other bad things it seems. For instance, I have seen a lot of claims that Canada wildfires are caused by climate change. First of all: No wildfire has one cause. There are multiple factors at play. That should be basic knowledge. I don't think anyone would claim that climate change ignited the wildfires, but there seems to be a common claim that wildfires spread more in the current climate than in a hypothetical Canada with no climate change. 

This is both a very easy and very difficult claim to check. Difficult because withouth climate change, everything would have been different. Temperatures, precipitation patterns, jet streams, etc. The butterfly effect and all. In that case, we might have seen little forest fires in Canada this year, but huge ones in Mexico instead, who knows. It is impossible to know anything about any specific weather event in the hypothetical absence of climate change. Not a useful exercise. What is easy to see, however, are trends. At least if we have empirical data, which we in this case do.

So here is the crux of the matter. **There is no clear trend in Canadian wildfires since 1980:** [Canadian Wildland Fire Information System | Canadian National Fire Database (CNFDB) (nrcan.gc.ca)](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb). How then, can climate change be the cause of the 2023 wildfires? Unless you think that climate change somehow started in 2023, this makes no sense. But I am going to try to steelman the argument nonetheless. What if climate change has caused an increase but there are other factors causing a decrease that obfuscate this trend. If this is true, we would expect to see something like droughts in Canada increasing over the last few decades, one of the major fire weather factors. But again, this is not the case:  [Drought and Agriculture — Climate Data Canada](https://climatedata.ca/case-study/drought-and-agriculture/) (scroll down to Figure 1). 

So if Canada has not become drier and wildfires have not increased in the last few decades, what is the rationale for blaming the 2023 wildfires on climate change? I might be preaching to the choir here, but I know a lot of non-skeptics follow this sub too. I'm curious if they change their mind when seeing these data or if they have other explanations. It took me like 3 minutes to google and find these data, so I am also wondering how people can just throw out these claims without doing this simple check. ",climateskeptics

Where I’m having a problem is that experiment has no way of knowing the actual concentration of co2 inside the jar. We’ve all seen cited our atmosphere has roughly 0.04% co2. So while co2 does increase temperature, without actually knowing the co2 concentration level it seems a rather worthless conclusion.

In fact, you can see through that last source that RES subsidies are always larger than fossil-fuel and nuclear subsidies. There are graphs of direct comparison.

That said, there's a bigger and more important lesson here, which is that all things considered, both subsidies are fairly similar. In other words, the government is taking tens of billions from the population for what amounts to a wash.

# 1. Energy in

Some you may have seen if you watch a welder or seen a furnace in use - hot stuff emits light. And describing this phenomenon really troubled physicists in the 1800's.Some of this light we cant see - for example soldiers use infra red to be able to see warm things at night eg vehicle exhausts / warm bodies.

But along come Max Planck and well he gives us this;

[Planck relation for a black body radiator](https://preview.redd.it/gfax3p1xnwkb1.png?width=334&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b3c15299cb90cdfe3110c61899e67818aad29db)

And this is the prediction of the Planck law as objects get hotter the type of light they emit changes.

For example if something gets maybe to 650K it will glow red hot as the only visible light it emits is red! As it gets hotter (say 1200K) all types of visible light are emitted so we get white hot.

And our Sun is just like any hot object its about 5700K so it is emitting (as predicted by the model) quite a bit of UV but also plenty of visible light.

Over all per m\^2 the energy the sun outputs is 1368 Watts.

But some of this is reflected (this is called the albedo).

[Albedo](https://preview.redd.it/qy1qk1dwrwkb1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=e581536d745d6bc70c92bc051a18b7a302499b1b)

So Albedo here is 31% (6+8+17)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pqtmfpyswkb1.png?width=439&format=png&auto=webp&s=2820ef4d648250f2b76fe9871760417ad92dc8d9

As the sun only shines on one half of the earth - we know from school that the area of the circle of the earth that the sun hits is pi r\^2 so our total solar energy is;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/krsk044btwkb1.png?width=195&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3a089cd3c637059a46ecfe8f171b1a90b95e1d

# 2. Energy out

And just like the sun the Earth is now ""hot"" only a couple hundred Kelvin so will emit energy - according to the Planck relation in the infra red. See the graph for the Planck relation above with the line for the 100K line - completely in the IR.

So how much energy is emitted? Well we need Wiens law and also to note that the whole sphere of the earth emits energy!

[Wiens law](https://preview.redd.it/va12h3crtwkb1.png?width=112&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0031a3e77f753054cdfd01007492dd67c70ac3a)

So we need Fe x the surface area of a sphere!

&#x200B;

[equation for Ee - total radiative energy of the earth](https://preview.redd.it/gmruvuabuwkb1.png?width=157&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b665e1cc3fd91c064c0f594e7dbdbb31312c674)

&#x200B;

# 3. Energy in = Energy out

So we have two equations for energy, one saying how much energy the earth gets from the Sun, the other saying how much energy the earth emits.

Now the clever part - we can predict the average temperature of the earth will reach eg at what temperature we stop getting hotter because that energy is emitted as IR.

&#x200B;

# 4. What are we missing?

So -19 degrees C is too low, none of us are sitting at our PCs in sub zero.

And what we are missing is the greenhouse effect.

If we remember the Albedo graph;

&#x200B;

[that pink line is key](https://preview.redd.it/qy1qk1dwrwkb1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=e581536d745d6bc70c92bc051a18b7a302499b1b)

What happens with some molecules like CO2 this IR energy is just the right frequency to excite them to a new energy level.

The gas molecule will go to that energy level and then emit the energy back when it returns to its unexcited state.

[Vibrational Modes of Carbon Dioxide (purdue.edu)](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/jmol/vibs/co2.html)

Now instead of 100% of that energy leaving the earth some of it will be reemitted back to the surface.

And this was in fact noticed way back in 1896;

[On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground (rsc.org)](https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf)

So I hope we are now at a point where we can agree that **the ""greenhouse effect"" is real** and observable (and if i have not been clear in areas or you would like to ask questions or for more information/data please do).

# 5. Going from the greenhouse effect to climate change

So hopefully we agree that some gases have the property of absorbing IR radiation (in fact chemists make use of this all the time to identify molecules or tell us about their bonding in a technique called **IR spectroscopy)**.

And when they absorb in the IR from light emitted from the surface they can feed some of it back.

The simple idea then is just that if we add more gases like this into the atmosphere that feedback effect will get larger and the earth as a whole gets hotter.

\--

# 6. Finally a word on policy

So just to sum up we have taken some science - not climate science this is core physics Planck, Wien, Infra Red spectroscopy etc all used in other applications be it chemistry or materials science and I would put it to you that we should be able to agree that some gases if added to the atmosphere will change our climate

And the final political point I would make is that if we dont all understand this and agree about the ""problem"" how can we have a real political debate about the solution?

Right now its mainly the left/globalists who cares most about climate policy and so the only show in town so to speak is John Kerry on his private jets or Al Gore with his (unscientific) claims of sea level rise.

What we really need and I think it would address some of the points 2. - 9. is call it what you want ""common-sense"" climate policy, a ""right wing"" climate policy, a ""populist"" climate policy

One where we we maybe do have taxes or laws against private jets.

Or where we don't use government to tell people how to live but instead we create incentives for private companies to innovate new solutions. And then you could have an election with two (or more) sides who all say - greenhouse effect is real, here is my policy to solve it and we can let the people choose what vision they want.

Now its only my opinion but I don't think climate hypocrites or alarmists would win such an election - but right now they are winning - because they are the only show in town.

It is probably because people are so occupied with not understanding the physics and inventing ""alternative theories"", that they do not spend time on the real issues of ""climate science"". It is great for consensus science to have such useful idiots on the other side. Anyway, this is real..

For instance you will find this from P. Minnis from NASA(!):

*This result shows the increased cirrus coverage, attributable to air  traffic, could account for nearly all of the warming observed over the  United States for nearly 20 years starting in 1975*

or..

*For a 1% change in absolute cirrus coverage with τ = 0.33, the GCM  yielded surface temperature changes (DTs ) of 0.438 and 0.588C over the  globe and Northern Hemisphere, respectively.*

To put this into context: This optical depth would mean that 28% of light gets absorbed, but 72% transmitted. So it means a relatively low optical depth.

Even the IPCC in its special report on aviation is quite explicit:

*The potential effects of contrails on global climate were simulated with a GCM that introduced additional cirrus cover with the same optical properties as natural cirrus in air traffic regions with large fuel consumption (Ponater et al., 1996). The induced temperature change was more than 1 K at the Earth’s surface in Northern mid-latitudes for 5% additional cirrus cloud cover in the main traffic regions.*

The IPCC furthermore suggests, for instance in its latest AR6, to mitigate global warming by artificially reducing natural cirrus clouds. This is funny, because in reality we are doing the opposite, that is artificially creating a lot of aviation induced cirrus clouds.

The theory thus is clear and undisputed. If we put a lot of artificial cirrus clouds into the atmosphere, then we massively heat the planet. The warming then however would be very one-sided so to say. It would have started in the 1970s, it would affect mainly the NH and largely exempt the very south of the planet, cause there is basically no aviation. It would perfectly match the pattern of warming we actually have.

The only plot-twist here is about the question if we actually do that. The IPCC claims that cirrus clouds would essentially all be natural, with aviation induced cirrus only having a minimal share of about 1%. So whenever you look and see cirrus clouds, they would be most certainly natural. Moreover, if air traffic should be halted or strongly decrease, the skies should not change significantly.

Since we kind of ran the real life experiment, we can answer what happened in spring 2020 over european skies, once lock downs cancelled most of the air traffic. A graph from Heerwarden et al 2021:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9kf4m2js2qkb1.png?width=344&format=png&auto=webp&s=419e6206a1fd2fa623e506f0fa2ccc20638e7934

Ooops! As spectacular and unprecendeted this result is, as much it was to be expected. If you cancel air traffic the skies become clear, something wittnessed before after 9/11. This however falsifies the IPCC position of air traffic having only minimal effects on cirrus cloudiness and only producing a forcing of some 0.06W/m2. Instead this observation suggests the opposite. But then of course we also know what causes not-so-global warming after all.

Unsurprisingly Heerwarden and many others instantly insisted there would be nothing to see here. The exceptionally clear skies of 2020 were ONLY due to weather, and had nothing to do with lock downs. Guess for yourself..

879,1693144601.0,The Logical Leaps Required to Be a Climate Alarmist,"Buying into the current narrative takes a religious amount of faith that defies all rational thinking:

1. You must believe the global climate is dramatically changing. Specifically, that it's warming.
2. You must believe that humans are responsible for that change by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
3. You must believe that this climate change is the cause of numerous natural phenomena, from rising sea levels to famines, and that these phenomena are indeed happening.
4. You must believe that these phenomena are an existential threat. That is, that humans cannot easily protect ourselves from these phenomena with technology we've had for thousands of years like sea walls.
5. You must believe that as an existential threat, the damage from these phenomena will at some point in the future outweigh the benefits of CO2-producing machinery, ie, the existential threat of abandoning modern techology. (Note *will* since they currently don't even remotely.)
6. You must believe that, if these phenomena do represent an existential threat, that the people best-suited to micromanage society to mitigate that threat are politicians and bureaucrats. (Frankly, the most absurd leap of them all. An asteroid could be heading towards Earth, and I wouldn't want the government in charge of stopping it.)

Yet I've never seen a climate alarmist provide bases for these six beliefs, much less even address them. In fact, they rarely even cite specific names. Instead, they just believe what the news says ""climate scientists"" say, which may even be worse than a cult because at least in a cult you usually see the figurehead in person.

EDIT: I should clarify and say alarmists occasionally address one and two, a handful of them actually providing convincing evidence. My mind is not made up.

By mixing both radiative greenhouse effect with the pressure thermal effect, you create an imaginary and false condition where the ""height of emissions"" rises in one universe with one set of laws, but then transposed into a different universe with different laws, this new taller height of emissions can't balance within the radiation budget because now suddenly instead of greenhouse gas causing the temperature lapse, it's pressure and altitude said to cause it.

In truth, there is no greenhouse effect. Back-radiation re-radiative heating or ""heat trapping"" or ""slowed cooling"" is not a thing. Colder air produces radiation that has too low average frequency to be absorbed by the average too fast vibrating, hotter surface molecules. ""Back-radiation"" is simply re-scattered, at the speed of light, back up into space. There is no absorption or heat trapping below.",climateskeptics

Many skeptics, after significant study, are aware that climate is an incredibly complex phenomenon with a myriad of inputs and non-linear relations to the heating outputs. This makes any belief in climate predictability to be absolutely hopeless. CO2 is one of numerous factors - solar irradiance, solar CME’s/particle forcing (a recent entry into the field), cloud formations, cosmic rays, geologic evidence, Milankovitch cycles, solar cycles, oceanic heat storage and circulation, modeling insufficiency due to this complexity, statistical analysis, data collection, differential equations etc. etc.

And for those who demand ‘peer-reviewed papers’ in the erroneous belief that it is the gold standard of science (which would be false even if peer review had absolute integrity), Wiley imprint Hindawi has retracted some 500 papers, citing ‘peer review rings… manipulating the peer review process.’ [https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/?utm\_source=substack&utm\_medium=email](https://retractionwatch.com/2022/09/28/exclusive-hindawi-and-wiley-to-retract-over-500-papers-linked-to-peer-review-rings/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

This is straight up fraud - they changed the temp records after 1999, which showed 1934-5 as hotter than 1999 by a good ways. After that, they ‘cooled’ the past so that 1999 now appeared hotter.

For my skepticism, it’s

3 Main points:

* CO2 was 10 X higher - over 4000ppm in the past, even during the 25 million year Ordivician Ice Age.
* the logarithmic nature of CO2 warming,
* Heat precedes CO2 in the historical record, putting the effect before the cause. The definition of science includes Cause precedes Effect in Time.

Subsidiary points

* removal of medieval warming period,
* data adjustments for temps in the 1930’s,
* the fraud of the hockey stick,
* the poorly established water vapor amplification effect pushing model temps from 1.1C / doubling to 4.5C,
* the attacks on skeptics with valid arguments,
* omission of solar factors like the magnetic field / cosmic ray / cloud connection (as CERN and Project CLOUD have shown)
* [NOAA’s list of hottest temps on record](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records/all/tmax#status) shows 73 records. Only 3 have occurred since 2000. 57 occurred before 1960.

* [hide the decline’ from climategate emails](https://climatediscussionnexus.com/videos/climategate-hide-the-decline-backgrounder/) (an act of fraud: deletion of the end of Keith Briffa’s tree ring graph showing temp decline 1960-1994).

Here’s a couple of quotes from the IPCC itself: p. 774 of Third Annual Report by IPCC, we read: ‘In climate research and modelling one has to recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear system and so long-term forecasts of the future climate condition are **not possible.**’

([NASA, from Gavin Schmidt no less, agrees](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/rossow_01/computer.html): ‘Unfortunately, that margin of error \[regarding cloud cover\] is too large for making a reliable forecast about global warming...to be useful, today’s climate models must be improved more than tenfold in accuracy.’ updated June, 2018.)

“I can’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin \[Trenberth\] and I will keep them out somehow, even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is!” \[Phil Jones, July 8, 2004, ClimateGate emails\]

898,1693088884.0,Does Greenhouse Effect Cause The Lapse Rate Or Is It Independent,"Greenhouse theory says that the rising height of effective emissions causes an energy imbalance.

Because, the pressure lapse rate leads to lower temperatures higher in the altitude so a taller height of emissions means less radiation and therefore a budget imbalance.

I get why warmists claim this. They want to contrive an excuse for why greenhouse gas “traps” heat. Using the pressure lapse rate to show less effective emissions with a one way increasing height of emissions is a good trap concept.

However, greenhouse theory also claims the greenhouse effect is responsible for the temperature lapse rate in the first place. Specifically, they claim that without greenhouse gas, pressure can’t create temperature.

Lol.

So if the height of effective emissions rises due to more greenhouse gas, wouldn’t that ALSO have to mean that the lapse rate has adjusted and higher altitudes are now more capable of emitting more radiation.

They say this magic phrase “the radiation is imbalanced there more energy in than out so nature must correct that balance by heating up.”

Yeah. The way conservation of energy works this is an instantaneous change from the change to the system that might cause an imbalance. In other words, if greenhouse gas is causing the lapse rate, then more greenhouse gas means a higher effective emissions height but it should also mean that that altitude becomes a more effective (hotter) radiative outlet.

But notice the fallacy. They claim pressure can’t cause the lapse rate in temperature, so it must be greenhouse gas concentrations producing temperature. They then claim that with a taller height of effective emissions, the lower pressure means lower temperature and less emissions. Wrong. If greenhouse gas causes temperature, then a taller height of effective emissions means the top of atmosphere has been made more effective at holding temperature.

They combine the greenhouse theory of temperature lapse rate with the pressure theory of lapse rate. 

Instead, it’s easier to just show that the effects and dynamics of pressure and gravity are more than enough to maintain a warm surface temperature even without any greenhouse gas. Therefore, there is no need for a greenhouse effect theory and so there is no need to resolve its fallacy. There simply is no greenhouse effect and it’s nothing but junk attribution science.",climateskeptics

...

>From 2010-2012, Berkeley Earth systematically addressed the five major concerns that global warming skeptics had identified, and did so in a systematic and objective manner. The first four were potential biases from data selection, data adjustment, poor station quality, and the urban heat island effect. [Our analysis](https://berkeleyearth.org/papers) showed that these issues did not unduly bias the record. The fifth concern related to the over reliance on large and complex global climate models by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the attribution of the recent temperature increase to anthropogenic forces. We obtained a long and accurate record, spanning 250 years and showed that it could be well-fit with a simple model that included a volcanic term and, as an anthropogenic proxy, CO2 concentration. We[ concluded](https://berkeleyearth.org/summary-of-findings) that the record could be reproduced by just these two contributions, and that inclusion of direct variations in solar intensity did not contribute to the fit.

So the hot bottle works mainly by heat lamps heating up glass or plastic or water, which then conduct to the gas, and because CO2 is more dense it has a higher heat capacity. The IR absorption doesn't even come into play because CO2 gets hotter in these experiments than its absorption spectrum.

He then shows that yes, CO2 absorbs IR. But then doesn't measure temperatures in that case.

Basic, beginner level atmospheric science shows the relationship between the pressure level, altitude and temperature in the form of the adiabatic lapse rate.

While high altitude parcels of air have already convected and converted heat energy into gravitational potential energy, in general the air is less dense which is itself a store of potential energy. Meanwhile, below, the air is hot.

While hot air radiates faster, it is balanced by stores of potential energy above which don't radiate at all. The basic existence of an adiabatic pressure gradient within an air column shows that the average temperature - corresponding to a level of radiation out - will be somewhere in the middle of the column, with hotter temperatures below and less dense, cooler air above.

If the starting condition of a system has more heat than what corresponds to the average temperature based on the radiation budget, then of course average surface temperatures will be higher than the blackbody temperature average.

This is absolute rudimentary basic science. It completely invalidates and precludes any greenhouse effect as signal in the data.

The idea of starting with a temperature of -18C and having to magically raise it to 15C is absurd when we know that the starting temperature is 30C and it distributes along a pressure gradient to achieve an average temp of -18C high up in the atmosphere.

The climate change consensus crew built their catastrophic climate change house of cards on the premise of *backdwelling radiation* or *back radiation*. In the diagram from NASA/IPCC below, you can find 324 W/m2 of Back Radiation, which is almost as much as incoming Solar Radiation, which - according to the diagram - is precisely 342 W/m2. This is a considerable amount of energy, which we get for *free*!

[Figure 1: A diagram with lots of arrows and numbers which has one purpose: to confuse you.](https://preview.redd.it/uxbgr1y5x1kb1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b01fe0a41c4a386aab8a263450881f02b1e48a5)

In reality though, the earth is not flat and it has nights and days; it has oceans, mountains, deserts, swamps and cities. There is a limit to how much averaging one can do in a diagram without looking like a fool. But this is the point: **make a diagram with a lot of numbers and arrows to confuse the audience, because the emperor has no clothes**.

Moreover, the concept of back radiation suggests that colder air can warm a warmer surface (note the arrow above Back Radiation pointing downwards). Skeptics refer to the 2nd law of thermodynamics: a colder body cannot warm a warmer body, because energy always flows from the warmer body to the colder body. There is no stream of photons from the colder gas that can warm up the warmer surface.

Warmists therefore hide behind the Stefan-Boltzmann law: E = sigma (Th\^4 - Tl\^4), with E being the energy exchanged between (black) bodies and Th being the high temperature (in Kelvin) and Tl being the low temperature. Because CO2 is supposed to absorb the black-body radiation emitted by the earth's surface, it causes the lower temperature Tl to increase, causing E to decrease, meaning that the earth's surface cannot lose as much energy when there is more CO2.

There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. It was never intended to describe heat exchange between a trace (green house) gas high up in the atmosphere and the earth's surface. It describes the heat exchange between two black bodies. A black body is a **surface which absorbs all incoming radiation**. Being able to absorb all radiation is probably the last thing you associate with a gas.

So how did we get here? Part of the blame can be put on Arrhenius and Tyndall, who lay the foundations for the ostracization of CO2, a trace gas which absorbs enough energy for the seas to boil. But more blame should be put on modern scientists, who were willing to ignore the basic rules in science because the government was funding their research with billions of dollars, as long as they were willing to support the desired narrative.

[Figure 2: This spectrum is what a satellite with a spectro-bolometer measures when it is pointed towards earth \(source of image: Claes Jonnson's blog\).](https://preview.redd.it/q8hwj6r9x1kb1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb9e8305c97a79edf0542ea39b730037684e835)

A breakthrough for the modern climate change consensus crew were measurements performed with spectro-bolometers on satellites (since the 70s), which showed a large dip in the black body radiation which was emitted by the earth (Figure 2). Finally: they found the stick to hit the dog! Look at the large chunk of energy absorbed by CO2! Every scientist wonders how to get more funding, and how to get their work published in Nature or Science. A lot of what is published in those journals is full of white lies, or made up, because the science is often thrown out of the window first.

This is what happened here as well.

How are spectra measured? A classical spectrometer is built around lenses, a diffraction grating and a camera/CCD array/CMOS array. The lenses and grating divide light in its spectral components, and the camera records (after calibration and linearization) photons as a function of wavelength or k-number (k = 2 pi/wavelength). Since the camera **collects photons**, it gives the intensity or radiance as a function of wavelength. A typical camera uses silicon (Si), which is sensitive to photons in the visible, but is not able to detect photons in the infrared, because they fly straight through the detector. It cannot be used to take the data displayed in Figure 2. InGaAs and HgCaTe cameras are more sensitive in the near infrared, but they don't operate beyond \~5 micrometer wavelength either. Figure 2 was therefore made with a *spectro-bolometer*.

While a spectrometer can measure intensity or radiance, a spectro-bolometer *does not*. Instead of measuring the number of photons that are collected for each wavenumber, **it measures the temperature** for each wavenumber. Figure 2 has black body curves for various temperatures, displayed in different colors. In the window for CO2, around 600 cm-1, the spectro-bolometer hanging in space measured a temperature of about 220 K, which was the results of CO2 molecules in the tropopause, which have a temperature of about 220 K. Water on the other hand does not occur in the tropopause (it is too cold), and therefore has a higher temperature.

Now we understand how a spectro-bolometer works, why does the y-axis mention Intensity (W/cm2 \* wavenumber)? This certainly implies the spectro-bolometer measures intensity or radiance, and not temperature! For this, we need to understand how a spectro-bolometer works. Claes Johnson did a lot of digging here. I am not going to repeat the details, but it should suffice to say that a bolometer does not collect photons and can therefore not measure an intensity. It is a sophisticated IR thermometer, *which measures a temperature*, and based on the temperature **and a bunch of incorrect assumptions** it spits out a number for the intensity, which is not based on anything you can find in a physics book. For instance, it uses the Stefan-Boltzmann equation, which (as we already know) only applies to black bodies, and certainly not to trace gasses. *What we see here is a straight lie, which only holds because most of us are afraid to look under the hood (or have interesting lives and no patience to deal with BS).*

[Figure 3: How to fuck over the earth's population with smoke and mirrors \(source of the image: Claes Jonnson's blog\).](https://preview.redd.it/78skt4ej32kb1.jpg?width=628&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31eaf35edebf62f89286699ef9bc8d1f81cea58a)

The fairy tail does not end here. Remember, there are thousands of modelers being paid by the government to create smoke and mirrors. Enter Figure 3, which is what you get when you give modelers the free hand: a graph which shows how doubling of CO2 takes out a bigger chunk of the black body radiation emitted by the earth. There is no such thing. This is a model without any experimental verification.

If you divide this 680 by 2 to distribute it to the night side, and say that 340 W/m2 is what arrives to Earth before any radiation converts into heat, you are robbing the Earth's internal energy budget of heat by the ratio of a fourth root.

When this magnificently large error is corrected (of assuming 340 W/m2 is radiation in, rather than 680), there is no missing heat from the Earth system requiring a greenhouse effect to explain.

As for the night side, we see that the adiabatic pressure gradient produces a thermal effect that distributes solar heat as temperature, pressure and density. Some of which is potential energy of gravity, some which is temperature. 

Thus, the final radiation out is balanced to match radiation in, but the surface temperatures will not in any way be the average blackbody radiation level for solar radiation divided evenly over Earth.

The convection of air, assisted by water vapor's creation of strong weather patterns, helps more evenly distribute this energy to the poles and night side.

This is demonstrative. When people who are a bit midwitted learn something that's challenging to them by putting in a lot of effort, they have natural instincts, particularly men, to ego-invest and treat that mastery as some sort of asset. They then will defend this asset as if it's property. In one sense they are correct that the knowledge they earned by training and study could earn them value in society. However, sometimes the things we learn aren't accurate, and it's especially hard for midwits to perceive this and even harder for them to give up their ego-investment.

I would love for an honest skeptic to come in and sincerely try to prove me wrong about the Greenhouse Effect. No, not some dismissive ego-invested midwit. Definitely do not care to argue with disingenuous climate trolls.

I suspect that leaves only the people who already agree. Still, genuinely would love to be convinced that I'm wrong IF there's a case for it. I don't see that case, hence the continued discussion of the topic.

As some argue, it's as if there's a demonic possession on the minds of the intellectual class that takes over on this topic, which happens to be about the public demonization of the molecule of life on Earth.

I just want to have a sincere discussion on the science and see if myself or the other party in such a discussion can be convinced one way or the other.

985,1692673752.0,We are not running out of oil,"Disclaimer: I am not a professional writer/author - just someone with an interest in this topic. I own shares in Transocean (RIG), a company which drills for oil.

Perhaps fed by the \~2007-2009 spikes in oil prices, warmists insist to ""invest"" in ineffective windmills and solar panels. ""If we don't do it for climate change or a cleaner planet, we do it because we are running out of fossil fuels"".

This is a myth. There is plenty of oil and gas.

Oil is a commodity like coffee beans and wool, which by itself is useless and requires refinery to become extremely useful in our daily lives. Because it was useless, for decades it was sold for just a few dollars per barrel (1 barrel = 119 liters). Let it sink for a second: [in the 50s a barrel of oil was sold for less than $3](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart). This was before the US figured out they could print themselves rich, but even adjusted for inflation, oil was sold for about $20 per barrel or $20/119 = 16 cents/liter. 

If as a country you are sitting on top of a lot of oil, knowing it is worthless, and you want to become rich, you have to come up with a cunning plan: a monopoly in the form of OPEC. By limiting the amount of oil sold on the market, OPEC was able to set a price, and even though Big Oil (Exxon, Shell, BP, etc.) could drill for oil in non-OPEC countries, they were not able to supply sufficient amounts of oil  to the market to undercut the OPEC set price.

And of course Big Oil did not care, because it generated good profits, they were drilling themselves rich. Governments loved this too, because their taxes on gas increased with rising gas prices (typically \~[1%](https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV) of government income). A win-win for everyone but the consumer.

Why are prices high if there is plenty of oil and gas? One: we are running out of *cheap* oil. While the  Saudis pump oil for around $20/gallon and the shale fracking revolution after 2008 showed there was still plenty of oil, as long as prices were right, prices have steadily increased to about $80/barrel (67 cents/liter). The Stabroek field in the waters of Guyana however has 11 billion barrels of oil, which can easily be drilled with current technology. The breakeven price is $35/barrel. For other offshore projects, it is at $40/barrel. For operators, these wells are a goldmine when they can sell the oil at $80/barrel.  

The higher oil prices are, the more interesting it becomes to go deeper into the ocean, to go deeper into the ground, or to access fields that have enormous pressures, where there is even more of the black gold available. Note these projects require time to develop. (Small) companies who can undercut ESG-driven Big Oil and OPEC are not going to develop if governments create too much red tape, and when ESG-driven banks refuse them loans. Follow the money...

We are not running out of oil, but a CO2 fear can help to fuel a Malthusian apocalypse in which oil companies are prevented to explore. It is probably wise to not let it happen, unless you believe wind mills and solar can supply sufficient energy.

#Abstract

This study examines the concept of ‘greenhouse gases’ and various definitions of the phenomenon known as the ‘Atmospheric Radiative Greenhouse Effect’. The six most quoted descriptions are as follows: (a) radiation trapped between the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere; (b) the insulating blanket of the atmosphere that keeps the Earth warm; (c) back radiation from the atmosphere to the Earth’s surface; (d) Infra Red absorbing gases that hinder radiative cooling and keep the surface warmer than it would otherwise be – known as ‘otherwise radiation’; (e) differences between actual surface temperatures of the Earth (as also observed on Venus) and those based on calculations; (f) any gas that absorbs infrared radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface towards free space. It is shown that none of the above descriptions can withstand the rigours of scientific scrutiny when the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics are applied to them.

#Epilogue

Joseph Priestley, Unitarian Minister and Scientist in whose name the American Chemical
Society’s highest award is given, identiﬁed CO₂ and other gases which he named ‘airs’. He called CO₂, which he collected from breweries, ‘ﬁxed air’ and oxygen ‘dephlogisticated air’. He, along with most 18th Century scientists, were adherents of the phlogiston theory, which posited that combustion involved the loss of a substance they called ‘phlogiston’.

Antoine de Lavoisier, considered the father of modern Chemistry, conducted many out-
standing experiments using the most sophisticated apparatus available at the time and
demonstrated that combustion was a chemical reaction of a substance with oxygen and
phlogiston became apocryphal.

At a time when the laws of thermodynamics had not yet been established, he coined the
term ‘caloric’ to explain the heat generated by combustion and that also in time became
discarded alongside phlogiston. Both these scientists stored and used many labelled ﬂasks and containers of gases, liquids and solids, but none were found labelled ‘phlogiston’ or ‘caloric’.

In one of science’s ﬁrst ‘thought experiments’ Pierre Prevost (1751–1839) conjectured that a hot body absorbed less radiation from a cold body than the reverse, and that both would eventually reach the same temperature. Thus, the theory of radiant exchanges came into being, a view that predated the more thorough understanding of the Laws of
Thermodynamics that came later. **Yet it is noted that aspects of Prevost’s 200-year-old
theory continue to be applied in regard to ‘net ﬂow’ of heat – a concept that radiation
ﬂows both downhill and uphill. The latter ﬂow is a violation of the Second Law, which
informs us that a hot body can absorb no radiation from a cold body to make it warmer
still**. 19

Radiative greenhouse supporters have theorized a blackbody as an all-absorbing entity,
capable of absorbing and retaining its own radiation to elevate its temperature and have
used radiant exchanges in support of their arguments.

In the absence of deﬁnitive experiments to demonstrate the reality of the ‘greenhouse
effect’, and in view of the failure of the previously enumerated deﬁnitions, the effect should join ‘phlogiston’ and ‘caloric’ in Science’s Gallery of ancient constructs.

An added difﬁculty is that so far no way has been found to be able to readily transpose or correlate experiments conducted in the contained, static, isothermal and isobaric conditions of a laboratory to the great vastness of earth’s atmosphere

#Conclusion

The various stated deﬁnitions of the greenhouse effect have been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and application of the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics. They were found to be unreal, and unless some new deﬁnition can be put forward that satisﬁes and complies with those laws, it can only be concluded that the concept of a ‘greenhouse gas’ or a ‘greenhouse effect’ has not been demonstrated and is thus without merit.",climateskeptics
